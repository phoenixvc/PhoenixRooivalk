---

## 1. Feature Summary & Problem Statement

**Feature:** Technology Deep Dive Page
**Problem:** Potential investors and partners lack a centralized, detailed resource to understand the core technology behind PhoenixRooivalk. The current marketing site provides a high-level overview, but a more technical audience requires more depth to build confidence and assess the project's viability.
**Solution:** Create a dedicated "Technology Deep Dive" page that explains the key technical components of the platform in a clear, concise, and engaging manner.

## 2. Scope

**In Scope:**
*   A new, standalone "Technology Deep Dive" page.
*   Sections for each of the core technologies:
    *   Pneumatic Net Launcher
    *   AI & Edge Processing
    *   Rust-Based Blockchain Evidence Management
    *   Dual-Chain Anchoring
*   Use of diagrams, illustrations, and code snippets to explain complex concepts.
*   A clear and logical flow of information.

**Out of Scope:**
*   A full-blown technical documentation site (this will be handled by Docusaurus).
*   Any interactive demos or simulations on this page.

## 3. User Stories & Flows

*   **As a potential investor,** I want to understand the technical differentiation of the project so that I can assess its competitive advantage.
*   **As a potential partner,** I want to understand the technical details of the platform so that I can evaluate its potential for integration with my own systems.
*   **As a technical user,** I want to understand how the system works so that I can build trust in the technology.

## 4. UX Considerations & Key Screens

*   The page should be visually appealing and easy to navigate.
*   The content should be broken down into easily digestible sections.
*   Diagrams and illustrations should be used to explain complex concepts.
*   The page should be fully responsive and display correctly on all screen sizes.

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   The page must be accessible from the main navigation menu.
*   All images and diagrams must be optimized for the web.
*   The page must be crawlable by search engines.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

*   A new "Technology Deep Dive" page is present on the marketing site.
*   The page contains sections for each of the core technologies.
*   The page is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
*   The page is fully responsive.

## 7. Metrics / Success Signals

*   Increased time on page for the "Technology Deep Dive" page.
*   Increased number of inquiries from potential investors and partners.
