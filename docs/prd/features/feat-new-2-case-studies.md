## 1. Feature Summary & Problem Statement

**Feature:** Case Studies Section
**Problem:** The marketing site provides a high-level overview of the technology, but it lacks concrete examples of how the technology can be applied in real-world scenarios. This makes it difficult for potential investors and partners to fully grasp the value proposition.
