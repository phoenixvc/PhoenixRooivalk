title: "Feature PRD: Interactive Threat Simulator"
---

## 1. Feature Summary & Problem Statement

**Feature:** Interactive Threat Simulator Demo **Problem:** The marketing site's
primary call-to-action, the "Interactive Simulator Demo," is a black box. Users
have no context for what the demo is, what it does, or what to expect, which
creates friction and suppresses engagement. **Solution:** Provide a clear,
engaging, and informative description of the Threat Simulator directly on the
marketing page. This will include screenshots and a summary of the key features
to set user expectations and increase conversions.

## 2. Scope

**In Scope:**

- A new descriptive section for the Threat Simulator on the marketing page.
- Inclusion of 2-3 high-quality screenshots of the simulator in action.
- A clear and concise summary of the simulator's key features.
- A prominent call-to-action to launch the demo.

**Out of Scope:**

- Any changes to the simulator itself.
- A complete redesign of the `InteractiveElementsSection`.

## 3. User Stories & Flows

- **As a potential investor,** I want to see what the Threat Simulator looks
  like and understand its capabilities so that I can assess the technical
  maturity of the project.
- **As a potential partner,** I want to understand the features of the simulator
  to see if it's a good fit for my needs.
- **As an early adopter,** I want to see a preview of the simulator to get
  excited about the product.

## 4. UX Considerations & Key Screens

The new descriptive section should be visually engaging and easy to understand.
It should include:

- A clear headline.
- A brief introductory paragraph.
- 2-3 annotated screenshots of the simulator.
- A bulleted list of key features.
- A clear call-to-action button.

## 5. Functional Requirements

- The new section must be fully responsive and display correctly on all screen
  sizes.
- The screenshots must be optimized for the web to avoid slowing down the page.
- The call-to-action button must link to the correct URL for the simulator.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- A new descriptive section for the Threat Simulator is present on the marketing
  page.
- The section includes at least two screenshots of the simulator.
- The section includes a bulleted list of at least three key features.
- The call-to-action button is clearly visible and links to the correct URL.

## 7. Metrics / Success Signals

- Increased click-through rate on the "Launch Interactive Demo" button.
- Increased time on page for the marketing site.
