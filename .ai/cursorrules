## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing
  unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`.
  Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before
  implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and
  logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the
  exact issue.
- Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

The system implements a specialized counter-drone defense platform with
blockchain-based evidence management:

## Core System Components

1. **Counter-Drone Defense Logic** (Importance: 90/100)
   `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator.tsx`

   - Real-time threat detection and neutralization simulation
   - Multi-sensor fusion for drone identification
   - Autonomous defense coordination
   - Threat pattern analysis and response calculation

2. **Blockchain Evidence System** (Importance: 85/100)
   `apps/keeper/src/lib.rs`, `crates/evidence/src/lib.rs`

   - Military-grade evidence recording for drone engagements
   - Dual-chain anchoring (Solana and EtherLink)
   - Tamper-evident audit trails
   - Mission-critical data integrity protection

3. **Chain-Specific Evidence Anchoring** (Importance: 80/100)
   `crates/anchor-etherlink/src/lib.rs`, `crates/anchor-solana/src/lib.rs`

   - Network-specific transaction handling
   - Custom memo-based evidence storage
   - Cross-chain validation systems
   - Blockchain-specific confirmation rules

4. **Address Validation Framework** (Importance: 75/100)
   `crates/address-validation/src/lib.rs`

   - Military-specific blockchain address validation
   - Chain-specific format verification
   - Custom checksum implementations
   - Cross-chain address normalization

## Integration Architecture

- Evidence outbox pattern for resilient blockchain anchoring
- Multi-sensor data fusion for threat assessment
- Cross-chain evidence verification
- Military-grade tamper detection

## Key Domain Features

- Blockchain-based audit trails for military operations
- Defense-specific transaction formatting
- Classified data handling protocols
- Geofenced operation zones
