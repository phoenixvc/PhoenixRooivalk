### Deployment

**🚀 Automated Infrastructure-First Deployment**

PhoenixRooivalk uses a three-phase deployment approach:

1. **Infrastructure** (`.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml`):
   - Deploy all Azure resources (Static Web Apps, Functions, Cosmos DB, Key Vault)
   - Automatically configure GitHub secrets
   - Run via GitHub Actions UI or CLI
   - See [Quick Reference](.github/QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

2. **Secrets** (Automated):
   - Deployment tokens extracted automatically
   - GitHub secrets populated (if GH_PAT configured)
   - Manual fallback instructions provided

3. **Applications** (Triggered on push or manual):
   - **Docs**: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs-azure.yml` → Azure Static Web Apps
   - **Marketing**: `.github/workflows/deploy-marketing-azure.yml` → Azure Static Web Apps
   - **Functions**: `.github/workflows/deploy-azure-functions.yml` → Azure Functions

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# One-time: Configure Azure credentials
gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --body "<subscription-id>"
gh secret set AZURE_CREDENTIALS --body '<service-principal-json>'

# Deploy infrastructure via UI: Actions → Deploy Azure Infrastructure → Run workflow
# Or via CLI:
gh workflow run deploy-infrastructure.yml -f environment=dev -f location=eastus2

# Deploy applications (automatic on push to main)
git push origin main
```

**Documentation:**
- 📖 [Deployment Workflow Guide](.github/DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) - Complete guide
- 🚀 [Quick Reference](.github/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - Cheat sheet
- 📋 [Deployment Sequence](.github/DEPLOYMENT_SEQUENCE.md) - Detailed steps
- 🔧 [Azure Setup](.github/AZURE_SETUP.md) - Secrets configuration



Additional workflows:

- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/ci-marketing.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-rust.yml`
- **Security**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for vulnerability scanning
- **Link Checking**: `.github/workflows/docs-link-checker.yml` for documentation links

See `.github/AZURE_SETUP.md` for Azure infrastructure setup and configuration.

### Cross‑site links (env)

- Docs site can link back to marketing via `MARKETING_URL` (build‑time env for
  `apps/docs`).
- Marketing site can link to docs via `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` (public runtime env
  for `apps/marketing`).

Set these as GitHub repository variables or Azure Static Web App environment variables
if you want absolute cross‑links.

### Redirects

Azure Static Web Apps handles routing via `staticwebapp.config.json` files in each app. Update these files if you need to configure custom redirects or routing rules.

> Notice: This repository contains restricted content intended for approved
> defense partners. Redistribution or public disclosure is prohibited. See

## Overview

PhoenixRooivalk delivers a layered, modular counter‑UAS capability for contested
EM environments. The public materials in this repository provide a high‑level
overview and governance. Partner‑only details (specifications, simulations,
integration guides) are shared upon approval.

## Mission

Transform proven pneumatic platform technology into two world-leading brands:
- **SkySnare™** for consumer sports and training markets
- **AeroNet™** for regulated, AI-enabled infrastructure security

We aim to prove reliability and safety at consumer scale, then apply that track record to high-value enterprise markets that demand compliance, automation, and measurable risk reduction.

## System overview (abstract)

- RKV‑M: Aerial VTOL mothership for picket, relay, and mini launch; resilient
  comms and survivability provisions.
- RKV‑I: Deployable minis (interceptor, decoy, ISR). Control via RF or optional
  fiber for jam‑resistant teleoperation. Non‑kinetic baseline.
- RKV‑G: Ground support rover acting as mobile GCS, mast, and logistics node;
  can bear fiber spools for engagements.
- RKV‑C2: Command, control, and data plane with strict QoS, eventing, and
  observability; weapon‑agnostic integration patterns.

For detailed specifications and planning baselines, see [`index.md`](./index.md)
(restricted).

## Operating modes

- Mobile picket: Extend detection/relay ahead of maneuver elements.
- Site‑fixed overwatch: Short micro‑tether or elevated optical mast.
- Fiber‑engage: Rover establishes fiber link for spoof‑resistant control.
- Logistics: Resupply, magazine swap, and net deployment support.

## Documentation

All project documentation is hosted on the live Docusaurus site (deployed to Azure Static Web Apps):

- **📚 Documentation Portal**:
  - Executive Summaries & Pitch Materials
  - Technical Architecture & Specifications
  - Business Plans & Market Analysis
  - Operations Manuals & Deployment Guides
  - Legal & Compliance Frameworks
  - Funding Opportunities & Resources

- **Deployment Guide**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) - Production deployment and configuration
- **Azure Infrastructure**: [infra/azure/README.md](./infra/azure/README.md) - Azure deployment setup

> **Note**: Documentation source files are in `apps/docs/`. Run `pnpm --filter docs start` to view locally.

## Operational tasks

### Evidence management (CLI)

- Rust CLI: `cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- <command>`
- Examples:

```powershell
# Record evidence
cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- record engagement_summary '{"missionId":"M-123","result":"success"}'

# Process anchoring jobs
cargo run --bin keeper -- --interval 5 --batch-limit 25
```

For runbook-style metrics capture, see the Operations Log template in the documentation portal.

## Access request (partners)

Approved defense partners may request access to extended documentation and
artifacts. Please see [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md) for intake details and required
information.

## Responsible use

This project is weapon‑agnostic by design. Integration of restricted payloads
occurs only under applicable law and export controls. See
[`RESPONSIBLE_USE.md`](./RESPONSIBLE_USE.md).

## Site Deployment

Both sites are automatically deployed to Azure Static Web Apps via GitHub Actions:

- **Marketing Site**: Built with Next.js 14 (static export from `apps/marketing/out/`)
- **Documentation Site**: Built with Docusaurus (static site from `apps/docs/build/`)

Deployment is triggered automatically on push to `main` branch. See the [Deployment](#deployment) section and `.github/workflows/` for workflow details.
