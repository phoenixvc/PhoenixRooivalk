    title: "The Challenge",
    duration: 60,
    icon: "⚠️",
    keyPoints: [
      "Swarm Attacks: 300% increase in coordinated multi-drone assaults",
      "Autonomous Drones: RF-silent threats bypass 64% of current systems",
      "Current Defense Limitations: 2-5 second response time too slow",
      "No Audit Trail: Legal defensibility concerns",
    ],
    script:
      "Modern drone threats are evolving faster than defenses. We're seeing a 300% increase in coordinated swarm attacks. RF-silent autonomous drones bypass 64% of current systems. Existing defenses have 2-5 second response times - too slow for fast-moving threats. They rely on cloud connectivity that fails when communications are jammed. And critically, there's no audit trail for legal defensibility. The result: critical infrastructure and military installations remain vulnerable.",
