### 13. Technical Deep Dive: Edge AI Performance

#### Optimization Techniques Applied

| Technique           | Speedup | Accuracy Impact | Notes                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| FP16 inference      | 1.5x    | `<0.1%` drop    | Default recommendation     |
| INT8 quantization   | 2.0x    | `<0.5%` drop    | Best for real-time         |
| TensorRT conversion | 1.3x    | None            | NVIDIA-optimized runtime   |
| Batch size 1        | N/A     | N/A             | Required for low latency   |
| Image preprocessing | 1.2x    | None            | Optimized resize/normalize |

#### Power Consumption

| Mode               | Power Draw | Notes                   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Idle               | 3.5W       | Raspberry Pi 4 baseline |
| Active inference   | 8.2W       | During detection        |
| Peak (with camera) | 12W        | Full system load        |
