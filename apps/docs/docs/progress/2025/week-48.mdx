# Week 48: November 25 - December 1, 2025

<DocumentDownload title="Week 48 Progress Report - Phoenix Rooivalk" />

## TL;DR (2-Minute Summary)

### 1. Hardware: Net Launcher System Ready for Prototype

- **Net Launcher Design COMPLETE**: Both launcher mechanism and net design
  finalized - ready for prototyping
- **In-House Kevlar Manufacturing**: Strategic decision to weave our own nets -
  reduces costs, eliminates international lead times, protects IP
- **Kevlar Sourced**: Pieter has domestic Kevlar stock available - no import
  delays, can begin immediately
- **Ground-Based Launcher**: Larger multi-shot canister in development - serves
  as backup system and future Grover UGV integration

### 2. Revenue: x402 Payment Protocol Implemented

- **Blockchain Micropayments**: Premium evidence verification API now
  monetizable
- **Rate Limiting & Security**: Production-ready with CSRF/M2M protection
- **Architecture Documented**: ADR-0016 published for investor/technical review

### 3. Market Intelligence: SA Not Ready, International Focus Confirmed

- **3 SA Airports Contacted**: Zero drone incidents reported - operators are
  compliant and responsible
- **Boeing Pilot Interview**: Confirms lasers/kites are current threats
  (cheaper, accessible) - drones will follow as prices drop
- **Strategic Pivot**: Validates international-first go-to-market (EU and Canada
  where problem exists and regulations support entry)

### 4. Platform: 370+ Commits - Major Technical Velocity

- **AI/RAG Integration**: All AI functions now use Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation with Azure AI Search
- **User Experience**: Profiles, onboarding, gamification with Firebase cloud
  sync
- **10+ ADRs Published**: Architecture decisions documented for due diligence

2. **International targets**: EU airports vs Canada CUAS Sandbox - which first?
3. **Timeline**: When do we demo the net launcher prototype?
4. **Net specs**: Confirm weave pattern and size variants with Pieter
5. **x402 & Solana**: Pricing model for evidence verification API? Expected
   transaction volumes? Solana gas costs at scale?

### 2. Marketing & Business Development

#### South African Airport Outreach Campaign

This week we conducted outreach to three small South African airports to assess
market readiness and gather intelligence on current drone threat perception.

**Airports Contacted:**

- 3 small regional airports in South Africa

**Key Findings:**

| Finding                 | Details                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current drone incidents | Zero reported - airports have never experienced a drone issue          |
| Operator compliance     | SA drone operators consistently have proper credentials                |
| Communication           | Operators engage in radio contact when approaching controlled airspace |
| Overall assessment      | South African drone operators are highly responsible                   |

**Analysis:**

The South African market appears to be in a pre-problem phase. Unlike
international markets (US, EU, Middle East) where drone incursions have become
regular occurrences at airports, SA has not yet experienced the catalyst events
that drive C-UAS adoption.

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **International Focus**: Our immediate go-to-market strategy should
   prioritize regions where drone threats are established:
   - United States (FAA-documented incidents)
   - European Union (multiple airport shutdowns)
   - Middle East (military/security applications)
   - Asia-Pacific (growing concerns)

2. **SA Market Timing**: South Africa represents a future market opportunity. As
   consumer drones become more affordable and prevalent, incidents will likely
   increase.

3. **Positioning**: Position Phoenix Rooivalk as a preventive solution for SA
   stakeholders, while focusing sales efforts internationally.

#### Boeing Pilot Interview

Following the airport outreach, we conducted an informal interview with a Boeing
pilot operating in South Africa.

**Key Insights:**

| Current Threat  | Prevalence      | Demographics              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Laser attacks   | High            | Low-income, less educated |
| Kite hazards    | Moderate        | Low-income areas          |
| Drone incidents | Low (currently) | Not yet prevalent         |

**Why Lasers and Kites?**

- **Cost barrier**: Drones remain expensive relative to income levels
- **Accessibility**: Lasers and kites are cheap and readily available
- **Awareness**: Drone regulations are not yet widely ignored

**Future Outlook:**

The pilot agreed that as drone prices continue to fall and technology becomes
more accessible, drone incidents will inevitably increase in South Africa. The
current low incident rate is primarily economic, not cultural.

### 3. Hardware Development

#### Net Launcher System - Design Complete

We have completed the design phase for our net interception system, including
both the launcher mechanism and the net itself.

**Net Launcher Specifications:**

| Component          | Status          | Notes                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Launcher mechanism | Design complete | Ready for prototyping                   |
| Net design         | Design complete | Optimized for drone entanglement        |
| Deployment system  | In progress     | Pneumatic/pyrotechnic options evaluated |

#### Kevlar Net Manufacturing Decision

**Challenge:** International orders for specialized nets have prohibitive costs
and lead times that would delay our development timeline.

**Solution:** We have decided to manufacture our own nets in-house using Kevlar
thread.

**Benefits:**

1. **Cost Control**: Significantly reduced per-unit cost
2. **Lead Time**: Immediate availability for testing
3. **Customization**: Ability to iterate on net designs quickly
4. **IP Protection**: Manufacturing know-how stays in-house

**Technical Approach:**

- Material: Kevlar fiber (high tensile strength, lightweight)
- Weave pattern: Optimized for drone prop entanglement
- Size variants: Multiple sizes for different target classes

#### Launcher Development - Ground-Based System

**Current Development:**

We have begun development on a larger canister launcher system designed for
multiple launches.

| Parameter          | Specification                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Canister size      | Larger format (multi-shot capable) |
| Launch capacity    | Multiple nets per canister         |
| Primary use case   | Ground-based defense system        |
| Future integration | Grover UGV platform                |

**Strategic Rationale:**

Due to current cost constraints, this larger launcher design will not be
suitable for our interceptor drones in the near term. However, this development
serves dual purposes:

1. **Ground-Based Backup**: Provides a stationary defense option for fixed
   installations
2. **Grover Integration**: The design will eventually be adapted for mounting on
   our Grover ground vehicle, providing mobile ground-based interception
   capability

**Note:** The interceptor drone-mounted launcher remains a priority but will
utilize a more compact, single-shot design optimized for weight and
aerodynamics.
