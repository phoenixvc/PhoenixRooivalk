## Presentation Walkthrough Script

> **Duration**: ~10 minutes + discussion
> **Audience**: Weekly feedback meeting (investors/advisors)

---

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Good [morning/afternoon]. This week was significant - we hit our first hardware milestone and validated our international market strategy. Let me walk you through the highlights."

---

### Slide 1: Hardware Progress (2 minutes)

> "Starting with hardware - the most tangible progress this week.
>
> We've completed the design for both the net launcher mechanism and the net itself. These are ready for prototyping.
>
> The big news: we've decided to manufacture our own Kevlar nets in-house rather than import. This gives us three advantages:
> - **Cost**: approximately 60% reduction
> - **Speed**: Pieter already has Kevlar stock domestically, so we can start weaving immediately - no international lead times
> - **IP protection**: the manufacturing know-how stays with us
>
> The ground-based launcher is a larger multi-shot design. While it won't fit on our interceptor drones due to weight, it serves as a backup system and will eventually mount on the Grover ground vehicle.
>
> **Bottom line**: First hardware milestone complete. We can start the prototype this week."

---

### Slide 2: Revenue Model (1.5 minutes)

> "On the software side, we've implemented the x402 payment protocol.
>
> This is blockchain-based micropayments for our premium API - specifically evidence verification.
>
> Why this matters: we now have a revenue stream that can start generating income *before* our hardware ships. Software revenue can help fund hardware development.
>
> The system is production-ready with rate limiting and security hardening. We've also published the architecture decision for technical due diligence."

---

### Slide 3: Market Validation (2 minutes)

> "This week we did direct market research - spoke to three small South African airports and a Boeing pilot.
>
> The results were... informative. Not what we hoped, but valuable.
>
> **The finding**: South Africa currently has zero drone incidents at these airports. Operators are responsible - proper credentials, radio contact when approaching airspace.
>
> The pilot told us the bigger problems in SA right now are lasers and kites - they're cheaper and accessible to low-income demographics. Drones will become a problem as prices drop, but we're not there yet.
>
> **What this means**: Our international-first strategy is correct. The problem exists in Europe and Canada today - and Canada has the CUAS Sandbox program specifically for testing. South Africa is a Phase 2 market.
>
> This is actually good validation - we're not wasting resources on a market that isn't ready."

### 2. Marketing & Business Development

#### South African Airport Outreach Campaign

This week we conducted outreach to three small South African airports to assess market readiness and gather intelligence on current drone threat perception.

**Airports Contacted:**

- 3 small regional airports in South Africa

**Key Findings:**

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Current drone incidents | Zero reported - airports have never experienced a drone issue |
| Operator compliance | SA drone operators consistently have proper credentials |
| Communication | Operators engage in radio contact when approaching controlled airspace |
| Overall assessment | South African drone operators are highly responsible |

**Analysis:**

The South African market appears to be in a pre-problem phase. Unlike international markets (US, EU, Middle East) where drone incursions have become regular occurrences at airports, SA has not yet experienced the catalyst events that drive C-UAS adoption.

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **International Focus**: Our immediate go-to-market strategy should prioritize regions where drone threats are established:
   - United States (FAA-documented incidents)
   - European Union (multiple airport shutdowns)
   - Middle East (military/security applications)
   - Asia-Pacific (growing concerns)

2. **SA Market Timing**: South Africa represents a future market opportunity. As consumer drones become more affordable and prevalent, incidents will likely increase.

3. **Positioning**: Position Phoenix Rooivalk as a preventive solution for SA stakeholders, while focusing sales efforts internationally.

#### Boeing Pilot Interview

Following the airport outreach, we conducted an informal interview with a Boeing pilot operating in South Africa.

**Key Insights:**

| Current Threat | Prevalence | Demographics |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Laser attacks | High | Low-income, less educated |
| Kite hazards | Moderate | Low-income areas |
| Drone incidents | Low (currently) | Not yet prevalent |

**Why Lasers and Kites?**

- **Cost barrier**: Drones remain expensive relative to income levels
- **Accessibility**: Lasers and kites are cheap and readily available
- **Awareness**: Drone regulations are not yet widely ignored

**Future Outlook:**

The pilot agreed that as drone prices continue to fall and technology becomes more accessible, drone incidents will inevitably increase in South Africa. The current low incident rate is primarily economic, not cultural.

### 3. Hardware Development

#### Net Launcher System - Design Complete

We have completed the design phase for our net interception system, including both the launcher mechanism and the net itself.

**Net Launcher Specifications:**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Launcher mechanism | Design complete | Ready for prototyping |
| Net design | Design complete | Optimized for drone entanglement |
| Deployment system | In progress | Pneumatic/pyrotechnic options evaluated |

#### Kevlar Net Manufacturing Decision

**Challenge:** International orders for specialized nets have prohibitive costs and lead times that would delay our development timeline.

**Solution:** We have decided to manufacture our own nets in-house using Kevlar thread.

**Benefits:**

1. **Cost Control**: Significantly reduced per-unit cost
2. **Lead Time**: Immediate availability for testing
3. **Customization**: Ability to iterate on net designs quickly
4. **IP Protection**: Manufacturing know-how stays in-house

**Technical Approach:**

- Material: Kevlar fiber (high tensile strength, lightweight)
- Weave pattern: Optimized for drone prop entanglement
- Size variants: Multiple sizes for different target classes

#### Launcher Development - Ground-Based System

**Current Development:**

We have begun development on a larger canister launcher system designed for multiple launches.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Canister size | Larger format (multi-shot capable) |
| Launch capacity | Multiple nets per canister |
| Primary use case | Ground-based defense system |
| Future integration | Grover UGV platform |

**Strategic Rationale:**

Due to current cost constraints, this larger launcher design will not be suitable for our interceptor drones in the near term. However, this development serves dual purposes:

1. **Ground-Based Backup**: Provides a stationary defense option for fixed installations
2. **Grover Integration**: The design will eventually be adapted for mounting on our Grover ground vehicle, providing mobile ground-based interception capability

**Note:** The interceptor drone-mounted launcher remains a priority but will utilize a more compact, single-shot design optimized for weight and aerodynamics.

---

### 4. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Implement x402 payment protocol | Enable premium API monetization | Revenue stream for evidence verification |
| Firebase Vector Search for RAG | Best integration with existing stack | Simplified architecture, lower latency |
| In-house Kevlar net manufacturing | Cost and lead time savings | Faster iteration, lower COGS |
| Focus on international markets first | SA market not yet mature | Prioritize US/EU/ME sales efforts |
| Larger launcher for ground systems | Cost constraints for airborne | Creates backup system + Grover option |
| Authentication gating for docs | Protect IP, track engagement | Better analytics, user identification |

---

### 5. Next Week Priorities

1. **Software**: Continue x402 testing and documentation
2. **AI**: Optimize RAG performance and expand training data
3. **Marketing**: Begin international outreach campaign targeting established C-UAS markets
4. **Net Manufacturing**: Source Kevlar materials and begin first net prototype
