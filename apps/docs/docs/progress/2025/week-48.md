# Week 48: November 25 - December 1, 2025

## TL;DR (2-Minute Summary)

### Marketing

- **South African Airport Outreach**: Spoke with 3 small SA airports - results indicate drone incidents are not yet a recognized problem in South Africa
- **Key Insight**: SA drone operators are highly responsible - proper credentials, radio contact when approaching airspace
- **Strategic Pivot**: Position for international markets where drone threats are already established, while monitoring SA market for future adoption
- **Pilot Feedback**: Boeing pilot confirmed SA's bigger issues are lasers and kites (cheaper, accessible to low-income demographics)

### Product Development

- **Net Launcher Design**: Completed design for both the launcher mechanism and net
- **Kevlar Net Manufacturing**: Decided to weave our own nets using Kevlar due to international order costs and lead times
- **Launcher Development**: Started bigger canister design for multiple launches - will serve as ground-based backup system (future Grover integration)

## Full Weekly Report

### 1. Marketing & Business Development

#### South African Airport Outreach Campaign

This week we conducted outreach to three small South African airports to assess market readiness and gather intelligence on current drone threat perception.

**Airports Contacted:**

- 3 small regional airports in South Africa

**Key Findings:**

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Current drone incidents | Zero reported - airports have never experienced a drone issue |
| Operator compliance | SA drone operators consistently have proper credentials |
| Communication | Operators engage in radio contact when approaching controlled airspace |
| Overall assessment | South African drone operators are highly responsible |

**Analysis:**

The South African market appears to be in a pre-problem phase. Unlike international markets (US, EU, Middle East) where drone incursions have become regular occurrences at airports, SA has not yet experienced the catalyst events that drive C-UAS adoption.

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **International Focus**: Our immediate go-to-market strategy should prioritize regions where drone threats are established:
   - United States (FAA-documented incidents)
   - European Union (multiple airport shutdowns)
   - Middle East (military/security applications)
   - Asia-Pacific (growing concerns)

2. **SA Market Timing**: South Africa represents a future market opportunity. As consumer drones become more affordable and prevalent, incidents will likely increase.

3. **Positioning**: Position Phoenix Rooivalk as a preventive solution for SA stakeholders, while focusing sales efforts internationally.

#### Boeing Pilot Interview

Following the airport outreach, we conducted an informal interview with a Boeing pilot operating in South Africa.

**Key Insights:**

| Current Threat | Prevalence | Demographics |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Laser attacks | High | Low-income, less educated |
| Kite hazards | Moderate | Low-income areas |
| Drone incidents | Low (currently) | Not yet prevalent |

**Why Lasers and Kites?**

- **Cost barrier**: Drones remain expensive relative to income levels
- **Accessibility**: Lasers and kites are cheap and readily available
- **Awareness**: Drone regulations are not yet widely ignored

**Future Outlook:**

The pilot agreed that as drone prices continue to fall and technology becomes more accessible, drone incidents will inevitably increase in South Africa. The current low incident rate is primarily economic, not cultural.

### 2. Product Development

#### Net Launcher System - Design Complete

We have completed the design phase for our net interception system, including both the launcher mechanism and the net itself.

**Net Launcher Specifications:**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Launcher mechanism | Design complete | Ready for prototyping |
| Net design | Design complete | Optimized for drone entanglement |
| Deployment system | In progress | Pneumatic/pyrotechnic options evaluated |

#### Kevlar Net Manufacturing Decision

**Challenge:** International orders for specialized nets have prohibitive costs and lead times that would delay our development timeline.

**Solution:** We have decided to manufacture our own nets in-house using Kevlar thread.

**Benefits:**

1. **Cost Control**: Significantly reduced per-unit cost
2. **Lead Time**: Immediate availability for testing
3. **Customization**: Ability to iterate on net designs quickly
4. **IP Protection**: Manufacturing know-how stays in-house

**Technical Approach:**

- Material: Kevlar fiber (high tensile strength, lightweight)
- Weave pattern: Optimized for drone prop entanglement
- Size variants: Multiple sizes for different target classes

#### Launcher Development - Ground-Based System

**Current Development:**

We have begun development on a larger canister launcher system designed for multiple launches.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Canister size | Larger format (multi-shot capable) |
| Launch capacity | Multiple nets per canister |
| Primary use case | Ground-based defense system |
| Future integration | Grover UGV platform |

**Strategic Rationale:**

Due to current cost constraints, this larger launcher design will not be suitable for our interceptor drones in the near term. However, this development serves dual purposes:

1. **Ground-Based Backup**: Provides a stationary defense option for fixed installations
2. **Grover Integration**: The design will eventually be adapted for mounting on our Grover ground vehicle, providing mobile ground-based interception capability

**Note:** The interceptor drone-mounted launcher remains a priority but will utilize a more compact, single-shot design optimized for weight and aerodynamics.

### 3. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Focus on international markets first | SA market not yet mature | Prioritize US/EU/ME sales efforts |
| In-house Kevlar net manufacturing | Cost and lead time savings | Faster iteration, lower COGS |
| Larger launcher for ground systems | Cost constraints for airborne | Creates backup system + Grover option |

---

### 4. Next Week Priorities

1. **Marketing**: Begin international outreach campaign targeting established C-UAS markets
2. **Net Manufacturing**: Source Kevlar materials and begin first net prototype
3. **Launcher**: Continue ground-based launcher development
4. **Documentation**: Update technical specifications with new designs

---

### 5. Metrics & KPIs

| Metric | This Week | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Customer interviews conducted | 4 (3 airports + 1 pilot) | ↑ |
| Product designs completed | 2 (net + launcher) | ↑ |
| Manufacturing decisions | 1 (in-house nets) | New |

---

### 6. Risks & Blockers

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| SA market slower than expected | Medium | International market focus |
| Kevlar sourcing challenges | Low | Multiple suppliers identified |
| Launcher weight for drones | Medium | Parallel compact design track |
