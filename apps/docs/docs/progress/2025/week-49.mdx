### 7. Hardware Development

#### Net Manufacturing Progress

Pieter made significant hardware progress this week with hands-on prototype work.

| Milestone               | Status      | Details                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 3D printed tooling      | ✅ Complete | Custom tools for net weaving           |
| Custom net prototype    | 🔄 Started  | First in-house net in production       |
| Manufacturing approach  | ✅ Validated | Proves we can make nets locally        |

**Pieter's Update:**
> "Ek het 3D tools geprint om net te maak en begin 'n custom net maak."
> (I 3D printed tools to make a net and started making a custom net.)

#### Significance

This validates our decision to manufacture nets in-house:

- **No international sourcing**: Eliminates import delays and costs
- **IP protection**: Manufacturing know-how stays internal
- **Rapid iteration**: Can test and improve designs quickly
- **Cost reduction**: 60%+ savings vs international orders
