# Week 50: December 9 - December 12, 2025

<DocumentDownload title="Week 50 Progress Report - Phoenix Rooivalk" />

## TL;DR (2-Minute Summary)

### 1. Strategic Pivot: Airport Defense Focus

- **Market refocus**: From broad military drone swarm defense to **airport drone defense**
- **Target markets**: High-risk European markets (near Russia/Belgium) with clear ROI
- **Rationale**: South African market has minimal threat/demand; international markets better
- **Entry strategy**: Prove concept in airport defense → Build credibility → Scale to broader defense

### 2. Funding Strategy: SOSV as Primary Target

- **SOSV accelerator**: $500K pre-seed, hardware-focused - Alistair's top recommendation
- **Critical insight**: Apply to accelerators **BEFORE** incorporation (maintains eligibility)
- **Multi-track approach**: Accelerators + SA grants + Middle East hubs + commercial AI projects
- **Application list coming**: Alistair to provide VC/accelerator list early next week

### 3. Advisory Partnership: Alistair Kim

- **Expressed interest** in advisory role based on drone AI industry experience
- **Previous success**: Built drone startup to $80M valuation
- **Current work**: Japanese drone company with Tokyo market listing
- **Next steps**: Offline discussion to define collaboration structure as equal partners

### 4. Hardware Progress: Launcher Prototype Sourcing

- **Pieter visited 5+ shops** sourcing pipes and fittings for first launcher prototype
- **More or less found** the materials needed for initial build
- **Next step**: Return tomorrow to purchase and begin assembly
- **Validates**: In-house manufacturing approach for launcher components

### 5. Documentation Features: Calendar & Meeting Summaries

- **Calendar integration**: New feature added to documentation portal
- **Meeting summaries**: Automatic meeting summary generation added
- **Continuing improvements**: Building out documentation infrastructure

### 6. Soonami Cohort 8: Final Meeting

- **Last meeting of the year**: December 12, 2025
- **Cohort wrap-up**: Concluding Soonami accelerator program for 2025
- **Relationships built**: Valuable network and mentorship connections established
