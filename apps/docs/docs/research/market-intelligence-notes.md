## November 2025 Market Intelligence

### Source: Drone & Sundry - "Drone Stuff This Week" (25 Nov 2025)

**Channel**: [Drone & Sundry](https://www.youtube.com/@DroneandSundry) (sUAS News
official channel)

**Summary**: Weekly industry news roundup covering C-UAS purchases, competitor
developments, regulatory changes, and urban testing challenges.

---

#### Key Intelligence Extracted

##### 1. European C-UAS Procurement Activity

**Development**: Dutch government purchased new drone defense systems, with
implications for Belgium and broader European deployment.

**Relevance to Phoenix Rooivalk**:
- European market actively procuring C-UAS solutions
- Government contracts flowing to established players
- Opportunity to position for future procurement cycles
- NATO interoperability remains important differentiator

**Action Items**:
- Monitor EU defense procurement announcements
- Track NATO C-UAS standardization efforts
- Consider European regulatory requirements in product roadmap

---

##### 2. DroneShield Competitor Intelligence

**Development**: DroneShield executives reportedly selling significant share
positions.

**Analysis**:
- May indicate concerns about future valuation
- Could signal internal doubts about growth trajectory
- Potential weakness in competitor position
- Market may be questioning DroneShield's technology limitations

**Competitive Implications**:
- DroneShield's RF-dependent detection is increasingly obsolete
- Autonomous drone threat exposes their technology gap
- Phoenix Rooivalk's multi-sensor fusion addresses this gap
- Opportunity to position against DroneShield's limitations

**Action Items**:
- Monitor DroneShield financial filings and insider trading
- Track DroneShield customer announcements for competitive intelligence
- Prepare competitive positioning materials highlighting RF-silent detection

---

##### 3. Kinetic vs Non-Kinetic Safety Debate

**Development**: Industry discussion around safety of kinetic C-UAS solutions in
populated/civilian areas. Key concerns:
- Projectile risks in urban environments
- Collateral damage from falling interceptors
- Regulatory restrictions on kinetic approaches
- Public perception and liability issues

**Phoenix Rooivalk Advantage**:
- **Net-based capture** is inherently safer than kinetic intercept
- Non-kinetic approach suitable for urban, civilian, and sensitive environments
- No projectile risks, reduced collateral damage concerns
- Better regulatory pathway for civilian airspace protection
- Lower liability exposure for operators

**Messaging Opportunity**:
- Position net-capture as the safe alternative for civilian protection
- Emphasize no collateral damage risk
- Highlight suitability for airports, stadiums, critical infrastructure
- Differentiate from Fortem's kinetic DroneHunter approach

**Action Items**:
- Develop safety comparison white paper (kinetic vs net-based)
- Create messaging for urban/civilian use cases
- Document regulatory advantages of non-kinetic approach

---

##### 4. Regulatory Developments

**Development**: New Zealand proposing mandatory exams for drone operators.

**Industry Trend Analysis**:
- Regulatory frameworks tightening globally
- Operator certification becoming standard
- Counter-UAS solutions must integrate with regulatory systems
- Compliance documentation increasingly important

**Implications**:
- Blockchain evidence trail aligns with regulatory compliance needs
- Audit capabilities become competitive advantage
- Integration with operator databases may be required
- Documentation features are differentiator, not just add-on

---

##### 5. Urban Testing Challenges

**Development**: Discussion of difficulties testing C-UAS systems in urban
environments due to:
- Airspace restrictions
- Safety concerns with live testing
- RF interference and noise challenges
- Limited access to realistic test environments

**Phoenix Rooivalk Opportunity**:
- WASM-based threat simulator enables safe virtual testing
- Simulation capabilities reduce need for live urban tests
- Can validate system performance before deployment
- Training tool for operators without airspace restrictions

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Competitors require expensive live testing
- Phoenix Rooivalk can demonstrate capabilities via simulation
- Lower customer evaluation costs
- Faster procurement cycles possible

---

##### 6. Canada Validation Tests

**Development**: Canada conducting counter-UAS validation testing, relevant to
upcoming CUAS Sandbox 2026 program.

**Direct Relevance**:
- Phoenix Rooivalk has applied to CUAS Sandbox 2026
- Canadian government actively evaluating C-UAS technologies
- Test results will inform procurement decisions
- Successful validation opens Canadian market

**Action Items**:
- Track CUAS Sandbox 2026 timeline and requirements
- Monitor Canadian C-UAS procurement announcements
- Prepare for potential validation testing participation
- Align development roadmap with Canadian test criteria

---

##### 7. Media Misinformation Analysis

**Development**: BBC and other media outlets publishing inaccurate drone coverage,
creating public confusion about capabilities and threats.

**Industry Impact**:
- Misinformation creates unrealistic customer expectations
- Need for education and accurate information
- Opportunity for thought leadership and credibility building
- Expert commentary can differentiate from competitors

**Thought Leadership Opportunity**:
- Publish accurate technical content
- Engage with defense/drone YouTube channels for credible exposure
- Provide expert commentary to counter misinformation
- Build credibility through accurate public education
