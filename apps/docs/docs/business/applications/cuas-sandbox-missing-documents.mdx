## Draft Response to PriviDox Email

:::tip Recommended Response Strategy

**Objective:** Maintain application position while honestly disclosing current
TRL status, with commitment to reach TRL 5 before the Sandbox event.

**Precedent:** The 2025 Urban Sandbox accepted TRL 4 applications with a plan to
achieve TRL 5 before the event date.

### Draft Email Response

<DraftEmailComposer
  to="ideas-idees@forces.gc.ca"
  subject="RE: CUAS Sandbox 2026 Application - Phoenix Rooivalk - Missing Documents"
  body={`Dear IDEaS Team,

Thank you for confirming receipt of our CUAS 2026 Application Form and for
identifying the outstanding documents required to complete our submission.

We are actively preparing the following materials:

1. Company and Technology Overview (One-Pager) - In preparation
2. Test Plan Template - In development
3. DND 552 Radio Frequency Spectrum form - Being completed
4. Demonstration Video - Scheduling recording

TECHNOLOGY READINESS DISCLOSURE

In the interest of transparency, we wish to clarify our current technology
readiness status. Phoenix Rooivalk's counter-UAS system is presently at TRL 4
(Component validation in laboratory environment) with validated detection
capabilities and proof-of-concept defeat mechanisms.

We note that the 2025 Urban CUAS Sandbox accepted applications at TRL 4 with a
commitment to achieve TRL 5 prior to the event. We respectfully inquire whether
a similar arrangement may be considered for our application.

TRL 5 ACHIEVEMENT PLAN

We have a concrete development roadmap to achieve TRL 5 (Component integration
validated in relevant environment) well in advance of the Sandbox dates
(September 14 - October 9, 2026):

| Milestone                     | Target Date   | Status      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Multi-sensor integration      | February 2026 | In progress |
| Field validation testing      | April 2026    | Planned     |
| RF communications operational | May 2026      | Planned     |
| TRL 5 validation complete     | June 2026     | Planned     |
| Demonstration video recording | July 2026     | Planned     |

This timeline provides a 2-3 month buffer before the Sandbox commences.

OUR COMMITMENT

Phoenix Rooivalk is deeply committed to participating in the CUAS Sandbox 2026.
We believe our kinetic interceptor approach offers a unique capability that
would benefit from the testing environment and end-user feedback that the
Sandbox provides.

We are prepared to:

- Provide monthly progress updates toward TRL 5
- Submit interim validation evidence as milestones are achieved
- Accept conditional selection pending TRL 5 demonstration

REQUEST

We kindly request guidance on:

1. Whether our application can proceed with a TRL 5 achievement plan
2. What interim evidence would support our continued consideration
3. The deadline for submitting our demonstration video

We remain committed to completing all outstanding documentation and achieving
TRL 5 readiness before the Sandbox event.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.

Best regards,
