# CUAS Sandbox 2026 - Eligibility Assessment

An honest assessment of Phoenix Rooivalk's current readiness for the Canada
CUAS Sandbox 2026 program, including identified gaps and recommended actions.

:::warning Honest Assessment

This document provides a candid evaluation of our readiness. The CUAS Sandbox
is a **government program** with strict requirements. We should only apply for
opportunities matching our current capability level.

:::

---

## TRL 5 Requirement Analysis

The CUAS Sandbox requires **TRL 5 or higher** at time of application. This
means solutions must have:

> "Completed integration of components and validation testing associated with
> TRL 5 must be complete."

### What TRL 5 Means

| TRL Level | Description | What They Want to See |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| TRL 4 | Component validation in lab | Individual parts work |
| **TRL 5** | **Component integration validated** | **Integrated system demonstrated** |
| TRL 6 | System demo in relevant environment | Field-tested prototype |

**Key Point:** They want to **SEE** that you're at level 5 - not just claim it.

## Phoenix Rooivalk Gap Analysis

Based on internal assessment (ref: Team discussion Dec 2025):

### Requirement 1: Integration Demonstration

| Aspect | Required | Current Status | Gap |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----|
| Component integration | Proven | Partially complete | Need full integration demo |
| Validation with actual solutions | Demonstrated | Limited testing | Need more validation data |

**Assessment:** Something we can work towards, but not currently demonstrable.

### Requirement 2: Actual Solution Validation

| Aspect | Required | Current Status | Gap |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----|
| Detection validation | Real UAS tests | Some field tests done | Need documented results |
| Defeat validation | Real engagement | Limited demonstrations | Need more test data |

**Assessment:** We cannot fully demonstrate this yet. Need demonstration of
validation with actual solutions.

### Requirement 3: Final Hardware Configuration

| Aspect | Required | Current Status | Gap |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----|
| Final hardware | Near-production | Development stage | Significant gap |
| RF communications | Operational | In development | Not ready |
| Backup C2C setup | Initialized | Not complete | Major gap |
| Mesh comms | Between drones | Conceptual | Not demonstrated |

**Assessment:** We cannot provide this. Our hardware is not at final/near-final
configuration.

### Requirement 4: Video Demonstration

| Aspect | Required | Current Status | Gap |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----|
| 3-min video | Unedited demo | Not recorded | Need operational system first |
| Real operation | Actual system | System incomplete | Cannot produce yet |

**Assessment:** Obviously cannot provide this without operational system.

---

## Honest Eligibility Conclusion

:::danger Current Assessment: NOT READY

Based on the analysis above, Phoenix Rooivalk is **not currently ready** for
the CUAS Sandbox 2026 application.

**Reasons:**
1. Cannot demonstrate TRL 5 with integrated validation
2. Hardware not at final configuration
3. RF/mesh communications not operational
4. Cannot produce required demonstration video

:::

## What This Program Is

The CUAS Sandbox 2026 is:
- An **actual Canadian Government** program
- Run by Department of National Defence (DND)
- Through Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS)
- With **real prize money** ($1.75M CAD)
- And **real evaluation** by military end-users

This is not a pitch competition or early-stage accelerator. This is for
**validated prototypes** ready for military testing.

---

## Alternative Pathway Recommendation

Instead of forcing an application we're not ready for, we should pursue
opportunities that match our current readiness level:

### Recommended: Accelerators & Innovation Events

| Program | Why It Fits | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Techstars** | Early-stage friendly | Business development |
| **Y Combinator** | Prototype stage OK | Growth & funding |
| **EUDIS Accelerator** | Defense focus, earlier stage | European market |
| **India iDEX DISC** | Accepts development stage | UAS/autonomous systems |
| **Israel Innofense** | Defense tech focus | VC connections |

### Why Accelerators Work Better Now

1. **Lower TRL requirements** - Accept concept/early prototype
2. **Development support** - Help reach TRL 5
3. **Funding without delivery pressure** - Build capability first
4. **Network building** - Connect with defense customers
5. **Validation pathway** - Get to government programs later

## Roadmap to CUAS Sandbox Eligibility

### What We Need to Achieve

| Milestone | Current | Required | Timeline |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| TRL Level | TRL 3-4 | TRL 5+ | 6-9 months |
| Detection Validation | Partial | Full demo | 3-4 months |
| Defeat Validation | Concept | Working demo | 4-6 months |
| Hardware Integration | Development | Near-final | 6-8 months |
| RF/Mesh Comms | Conceptual | Operational | 4-6 months |
| Video Demonstration | None | 3-min unedited | After above |

### Realistic Timeline

```
Q1 2026: Focus on accelerators, build capability
Q2 2026: Achieve TRL 5 validation
Q3 2026: Attend CUAS Sandbox 2026 as observer (if possible)
Q4 2026: Prepare for CUAS Sandbox 2027/2028
```

## Previous CUAS Sandbox Reference

The November 2025 YouTube livestream about the **Urban Drone Detect Sandbox**
was hosted by the same Canadian Government IDEaS program. This shows:

1. They run multiple sandbox events
2. There will be future opportunities
3. We can learn from their published results

**Action:** Review the 2024 CUAS Sandbox results and Urban Drone Detect
Sandbox to understand what successful applicants demonstrated.

## Decision Matrix

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Apply Anyway** | Shows interest | Likely rejection, wastes effort | Not recommended |
| **Withdraw Application** | Honest, saves resources | Miss this cycle | Recommended |
| **Partial Submission** | Some visibility | Incomplete = disqualified | Not recommended |
| **Focus on Accelerators** | Build capability, better fit | Delays government program | **Best Option** |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. [ ] Assess if partial application already submitted needs withdrawal
2. [ ] Identify Q1 2026 accelerator applications
3. [ ] Create TRL 5 achievement roadmap
4. [ ] Document current capabilities for future applications

### Accelerator Applications to Prioritize
