## Prize Strategy

### Target Tracks
| Track | Fit | Strategy |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Evidence/Storage | High | Drone footage hashing |
| ZK Proofs | Medium | Chain of custody |
| DeFi | Medium | x402 payments |
| AI+Crypto | High | AI detection + blockchain |

### Winning Tips
1. **Solve real problem**: Not just blockchain for blockchain's sake
2. **Polish demo**: UX matters even in hackathons
3. **Tell a story**: Judges remember narratives
4. **Target bounties**: Multiple prizes possible
5. **Ship something**: Working > ambitious but broken
