## The Challenge

> "How might we detect and/or defeat Micro and Mini Uncrewed Aerial Systems
> (UAS) with systems that can be integrated into the broader military command
> and control system?"

Building on the results of the 2024 CUAS Sandbox, DND and the Canadian Armed
Forces (CAF) seek CUAS solutions capable of detecting and/or defeating Micro and
Mini UAS that can integrate into broader military command and control systems.

## Operational Scenarios

DND/CAF is interested in solutions that address the following six operational
scenarios in both day and night conditions:

### 1. Operating Base

Defending a Forward Operating Base (FOB), airfield, or VIP conference location:

- Static deployment once positioned
- Equipment size and power consumption not major constraints
- Perimeter defense: 2.5 km radius circle
- Must distinguish authorized vs. non-authorized aircraft

### 2. Mobile Vehicle

Defending a mobile vehicle force element:

- Patrol of five vehicles
- CUAS system must be vehicle-mounted and powered
- Creates defensive bubble while on the move

### 3. Dismounted Personnel

Defending a small element of 12 dismounted soldiers or VIP group:

- CUAS system must be "Person Portable"
- Ideally operates while group is moving
- Creates defensive bubble around the group

### 4. Urban Environment

Operating in complex urban scenarios:

- Cluttered infrastructure and electromagnetic environments
- Defense area: 4 x 4 city blocks
- Office towers up to 10 stories
- Must handle RF interference and multipath

### 5. Naval Environment

Defending an RCN frigate-sized ship:

- Underway in littoral waters (straits to confined harbor entries)
- Alongside dock or anchored in harbor
- Must handle ship superstructure obstacles
- Unique electromagnetic environment
- Various speeds and movements
- Must withstand marine salt environment

### 6. Linear Border Monitoring

Monitoring and defending linear borders:

- Military front lines or geo-political boundaries
- For comparison: How many systems at what spacing for 10 km coverage?

## CUAS Methodologies

| Method                | Description                                                    | Considerations                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Active Detection**  | Transmitting signals to detect UAS (e.g., radar)               | May reveal transmitter location |
| **Passive Detection** | Detecting UAS from effects it generates (visual, RF, acoustic) | Conceals own position           |
| **Soft-Kill**         | RF effects, cyber, or other methods to deter/disable/takeover  | Non-kinetic neutralization      |
| **Hard-Kill**         | Ammunition, nets, missiles, lasers, microwaves                 | Physical neutralization         |

---

## Technology Areas of Interest

### High Priority (Selection Emphasis)

- **Hard-kill solutions**: Particularly proximity munitions
- **Directed energy**: Lasers and microwaves
- **Beyond line-of-sight capability**
- **Networks of low-cost sensors**

### Known Methods (Less Likely Unless Improved)

Detection:

- Radar
- Acoustic
- Radio Frequency (RF) Signal
- Optical

Defeat:

- RF Jamming and Cyber
- Nets
- Small arms ballistic projectiles

:::tip Selection Criteria

Technologies and concepts that are **new, different, and have unknown future
potential** will be of higher interest relative to technologies largely
duplicating existing solutions.

| **Defeat Only**     | Solutions that cannot do initial detection but can target and defeat threats once cued |
| **Detect & Defeat** | Combined detection and defeat capability                                               |

:::note Fair Competition

Solutions in different categories compete only against others in the same

> require the appropriate capabilities to identify and defend against these
> burgeoning threats." (page 73)

The CAF is establishing a strategic-level **Joint CUAS Office (JCO)** for
coordination across:

- Canadian Army (CA)
- Royal Canadian Navy (RCN)
- Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)
- Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM)
- Allied partners
