## Market Opportunity: Explosive Growth in Counter-Drone Systems

The C-UAS market presents exceptional opportunities, valued at **$2.45-3.0B in
2025** and projected to reach **$9-15B by 2030** at 23-27% CAGR. The Pentagon
Replicator program alone commits **$500M** to deploy thousands of autonomous
drones by August 2026, while recent contract awards total over **$6B** including
Raytheon's massive $5.04B Coyote interceptor contract through 2033. Ukraine's
experience losing 10,000 drones monthly to jamming demonstrates urgent
operational needs driving procurement.
