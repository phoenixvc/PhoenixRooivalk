### Slide 2: The Challenge

**Modern Drone Threats Are Evolving Faster Than Defenses**

**Current Threats:**

- **Swarm Attacks**: 300% increase in coordinated multi-drone assaults
- **Autonomous Drones**: RF-silent threats bypass 64% of current systems
- **Commercial Proliferation**: 2.8M registered drones in US alone
- **Malicious Use**: Drug smuggling, surveillance, kinetic attacks

**Current Defense Limitations:**

- **2-5 Second Response Time**: Too slow for fast-moving threats
- **Cloud Dependency**: Systems fail when communications are jammed
- **No Audit Trail**: Legal defensibility concerns
- **High False Positive Rates**: 15-25% causing operational disruption

**The Result**: Critical infrastructure and military installations remain
vulnerable to evolving drone threats.
