## Presentation Tips

### Opening Strong

Start with the Brussels incident - it's recent, relatable, and demonstrates urgency:

> *"Last month, Brussels Airport was closed twice in one night. 54 flights cancelled. The UK sent Royal Air Force specialists. And this is happening across Europe - incidents are up 4x year over year."*

### The Gatwick Story

Use Gatwick 2018 to emphasize the evidence problem:

> *"Remember Gatwick 2018? £60 million in damages, 140,000 passengers stranded. And the perpetrators? Never caught. Why? No evidence chain. That's the problem we solve."*

### Competitive Positioning

Lead with speed advantage - it's the strongest differentiator:

> *"50-195 milliseconds. That's how fast we respond. Competitors take 5 to 30 seconds. We're 10 to 150 times faster. And we do it completely offline."*
