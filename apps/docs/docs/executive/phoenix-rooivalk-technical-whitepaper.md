## Revolutionary SAE Level 4 Autonomous Counter-UAS Defense Platform

**Nexamesh Technologies** | **Delaware C-Corp (in progress) + South African
Entity (planned)** | **2025**

---

## Abstract

This technical whitepaper presents the Phoenix Rooivalk counter-drone defense
system, a revolutionary SAE Level 4 autonomous platform that combines
cutting-edge artificial intelligence with military-grade blockchain
infrastructure. The system addresses critical gaps in current counter-drone
technology through edge-first processing, immutable evidence anchoring, and
modular architecture designed for global deployment. Phoenix Rooivalk achieves
sub-200ms response times with 95%+ detection accuracy while maintaining complete
operational autonomy in GPS-denied and electronically contested environments.
The platform leverages advanced AI integration (Morpheus Network, Cognitive
Mesh) and dual-chain blockchain evidence (Hedera + Private Chain + Solana) to
deliver cost-competitive solutions to the rapidly growing $6.64 billion
global counter-drone market (projected to reach $20.31B by 2030).
