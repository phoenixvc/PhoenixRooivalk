## What Phoenix Rooivalk Does (Plain English)

Phoenix Rooivalk is a **defensive system** that detects, classifies, and
responds to hostile small drones on its own when radios and backhaul are jammed.
It makes **policy-bounded, "soft kill first" decisions at the edge** in {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME} (p50) / ≤250 ms (p95) and records tamper-evident receipts after the fact for
accountability.

When communications are available, it can optionally share sanitized,
need-to-know alerts with partners; **real-time action never waits on external
networks**. Humans remain in control for anything risky or lethal.

## What It Does NOT Do

- **It doesn't need the cloud** or a big server to make decisions
- **It doesn't fire dangerous weapons by itself**; humans must authorize that
- **It doesn't share private raw video or audio** by default—only small, safe
  alerts unless approved

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What happens with the "black box" if the drone is lost/shot-down/intercepted and no comms was available?

**Great question!** As currently implemented, the "black box" will persist, so
the data might be utilized if retrieved.

**Solution - Automatic data wipe:**

| Condition                    | Action             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| No signal for 60 seconds     | Data erases itself |
| Drone leaves authorized area | Data erases itself |
| Someone tries to tamper      | Data erases itself |

**Implementation:**

- Cost to add: Almost nothing
- Time to add: 1 week
- **This should definitely be in Version 1**

---

### Q2: What is considered "nearby"? If the brain is not on the drone, and radio comms not available – how will decisions be made?

**"Nearby" = 500m to 1km between defense nodes** (like cell towers but for drone
defense)

**How it works without radio - Think of a flock of birds:**

- No radios
- They still turn together instantly
- Each bird watches its neighbors and reacts

**Our system does the same:**

Each defense node watches its area and shares what it sees using:

| Method                | Description         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Light signals**     | Like fireflies      |
| **Sound pulses**      | Like dolphins       |
| **Ground vibrations** | Not v1, but planned |

**All nodes react together in 12 milliseconds**

**Real example:**

```
Node A: "I see a drone!" (flashes light pattern)
Node B: "I see it too!" (sends sound pulse)
Both: "Attack!" (synchronized response)
Time: 0.012 seconds - faster than a blink
```

**Why this matters:**

| Advantage                           | Benefit                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Works when enemies jam everything   | Huge advantage               |
| No expensive satellite links needed | Saves millions               |
| Can't be hacked remotely            | No central control to attack |
| Patent opportunity                  | Nobody else does this        |

**Bottom line:** Like ants protecting their colony, our system keeps working
even when "blind and deaf" to radio signals. **This is one of the best features,
and not well documented.**

---

### Q3: How does the human "authorize" firing of weapons without radio signal or cloud comms?

**Solution: Always Keep One "Phone Line" Open**

| Type        | Method                                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary** | Fiber cable from operator → rover → weapons authorization (Can't be jammed, can't be hacked) |
| **Backup**  | Pre-set rules before mission starts ("If threat enters 200m zone, defend")                   |

**How it works:**

```
Jamming starts → 9 nodes go autonomous (detect only)
              → 1 node keeps fiber link through rover
              → Human authorizes through fiber
              → All nodes get the "go" signal via light/sound
              → Response in &lt;1 second
```

**Why this is better than radio:**

- Fiber can't be jammed or hacked
- Meets legal requirements (human decides lethal force)
- Multiple backup paths if one fails

## System Architecture Overview

### The Challenge

Modern sUAS are proliferating, RF-silent, and swarm-capable. Centralized C2
architectures fail under EW. Most systems degrade to detect-only when comms die.

### Key Differentiators

| Feature                  | Capability                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network independence** | At the edge; ledger and interop strictly off-path                                            |
| **RF silent detection**  | Via multi-modal fusion                                                                       |
| **Swarm handling**       | ≥50 concurrent tracks (baseline)                                                             |
| **Coalition sharing**    | Classification-aware controls; Link 16/MADL receive only initially                           |
| **Evidence-grade audit** | Fabric: hashes & metadata on chain, full evidence in off-chain WORM stores; ~{BLOCKCHAIN.TPS_REAL_WORLD} TPS |

### Real Combat Example

```
Enemy drone swarm approaching (heavy jamming active):

0.000s: Edge nodes detect drones (no network needed)
0.008s: Nodes share via light/sound signals
0.012s: Soft-kill jamming starts (pre-authorized)
0.015s: Alert sent to operator (via fiber if available)

1.000s: Human sees alert, authorizes harder response
1.100s: Kinetic interceptor launched

Later:  Full event recorded to blockchain for legal record
```

### Key Point for Investors

**Traditional System (needs network):**

```
Detect → Send to HQ → Wait → Get Permission → Act
Time: 3-10 seconds ❌ (drone already dropped payload)
```

**Phoenix Rooivalk (edge autonomy):**

```
Detect → Act (within pre-set rules) → Inform HQ → Record
Time: 0.012 seconds ✅ (drone neutralization initialized)
```

**The Magic:** Critical decisions happen at the edge in milliseconds. Humans set
the rules beforehand and can override when connected. Blockchain just keeps the
receipts.

### IOC (Illustrative)

- 4 node site
- 2 soft-kill effectors integrated
- Fabric audit live on classification-appropriate channel
- Ops handbook v1.0
- Interop pilot active

### Power Consumption

- {HARDWARE.POWER_TYPICAL}-{HARDWARE.POWER_PEAK} per node ({HARDWARE.COMPUTE_PLATFORM} class)
- Earlier internal studies referenced kW-class configurations for heavy/legacy
  payloads; this proposal standardizes on Orin-class nodes
