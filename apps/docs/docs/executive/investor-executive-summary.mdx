## The Problem & Opportunity

The outdoor sports toy market is valued at **{SKYSNARE.TARGET_MARKET}**¹, while the
enterprise counter-drone security market is **{MARKET.CURRENT}**, growing to **$12.24B by
2032**².

Phoenix Rooivalk is uniquely positioned to capture both markets through
separate, focused brands sharing core technology.

### Market Segmentation

## Development Status

### Phase 1a: Mechanical Prototype Under Development

- Mechanical prototype currently in build and subsystem integration stage
- Initial component-level tests demonstrate basic net deployment and recovery
- Safety and fail-safe systems undergoing refinement and verification
- Focus areas: endurance, mechanical consistency, and environmental resilience
- **Next milestone**: Full-scale integrated mechanical prototype ready for field
  evaluation (Q1 2026)

### Subsystem Progress

| Subsystem          | Status       |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Pneumatic launcher | 60% complete |
| Net deployment     | 40% complete |
