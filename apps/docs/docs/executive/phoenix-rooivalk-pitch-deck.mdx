### The Origin

The founding team came together with a shared frustration: **watching the
Gatwick 2018 incident unfold with no prosecution possible because there was no
evidence chain.**

We're engineers who've spent careers building systems that work in harsh
conditions - mining, energy, defense. We saw:

- Drones threatening critical infrastructure with no affordable defense
- Enterprise solutions at $1M+ locked out regional airports
- No one combining AI speed with blockchain evidence

### Why This Team?

- **Jurie Smit** (CTO): 15+ years building real-time systems. Saw the gap
  between AI capability and deployment speed.
- **Martyn Redelinghuys** (CEO): 20+ years in defense & energy. Knows the
  procurement cycles and what enterprises actually buy.
- **Founder-market fit**: We've built safety-critical systems before. We know
  hardware. We know blockchain. We're not learning on the job.

### The Moment of Clarity

_November 2025: Brussels Airport closes twice in one night. UK sends RAF troops.
Drones spotted near nuclear weapons storage. And still - no affordable solution
for regional airports._

We decided: **Build it ourselves, or watch the problem get worse.**

## Market: TAM → SAM → SOM

:::info Soonami Element: The Market TAM, SAM, SOM - be realistic in your
assessment. Investors will judge you on these assumptions. :::

### Bottom-Up Market Analysis

| Market Layer              | Size                                  | Calculation                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TAM** (Total)           | {MARKET.CURRENT} → {MARKET.PROJECTED} | Global C-UAS market (MarketsandMarkets 2025)                                              |
| **SAM** (Serviceable)     | ~$1.5B                                | Regional airports + event venues + critical infrastructure (non-military, non-government) |
| **SOM** (Obtainable Y1-3) | $15-25M                               | 15-20 enterprise customers × avg $1M lifetime value                                       |

### SOM Calculation (Conservative)

| Segment                | Y1     | Y2    | Y3     | Rationale        |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
| **SkySnare Consumer**  | $1.75M | $6.5M | $12M   | 5K→15K→30K units |
| **AeroNet Enterprise** | $0.4M  | $3.2M | $8.5M  | 2→8→15 customers |
| **Total**              | $2.15M | $9.7M | $20.5M |                  |

### Why We Can Capture This

1. **Price point**: $150K vs $1M+ = 10x more accessible
2. **Edge AI**: Works offline, no cloud dependency
3. **Blockchain evidence**: Only solution with prosecution trail
4. **Dual brand**: Consumer funds enterprise R&D

## Go-to-Market Strategy

:::info Soonami Element: Go2Market How do you specifically want to enter the
market? Where do you want to focus first? :::

### Phase 1: Consumer Beachhead (SkySnare)

| Element             | Strategy                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First customers** | Active families with HHI $75K+, 2+ children                    |
| **Channel**         | D2C website (70%), Amazon (30%)                                |
| **Acquisition**     | Influencer partnerships (outdoor sports), targeted Meta/Google |
| **CAC target**      | {SKYSNARE.CAC}                                                 |
| **Geography**       | USA first, then EU (CE marking)                                |
| **Timeline**        | Launch Q2 2026                                                 |

### Phase 2: Enterprise Entry (AeroNet)

| Element             | Strategy                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **First customers** | Regional airports (non-hub), event venues       |
| **Beachhead**       | South Africa (home market), then EU regional    |
| **Sales cycle**     | 6-9 months (faster than enterprise norm)        |
| **Entry wedge**     | Pilot program at $50K, convert to full at $150K |
| **Channel**         | Direct sales + security integrator partnerships |
| **Timeline**        | First pilot Q3 2026, first paying Q1 2027       |

### Why This Sequence?

```
Consumer (SkySnare)          Enterprise (AeroNet)
────────────────────         ────────────────────
• Faster time to market      • Longer sales cycle
• Lower regulatory bar       • Higher regulatory bar
• Validates tech             • Validates at scale
• Funds R&D                  • Higher margins
        ↓                            ↓
   Year 1 focus              Year 2+ expansion

### Our Sustainable Advantage

1. **Speed moat**: Edge AI architecture can't be easily retrofitted onto cloud
   systems
2. **Evidence moat**: Blockchain integration from day 1, not bolted on
3. **Cost moat**: In-house net manufacturing keeps margins high
4. **Dual-revenue moat**: Consumer revenue insulates from enterprise sales
   cycles

### Indirect Competition

| Alternative          | Why We Win                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Do nothing**       | Nov 2025 shows this is no longer acceptable |
| **Manual patrols**   | Can't match AI response time                |
| **RF jamming only**  | No capture, no evidence, legal issues       |
| **Military systems** | $5M+, overkill for regional airports        |

### Why Competitors Can't Solve This

- **Response time**: 5-30 seconds (ours: {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME})
- **Cost**: $1M+ enterprise systems (ours: {AERONET.SETUP_FEE} +
  {AERONET.MONTHLY_FEE})
- **Evidence**: No blockchain chain-of-custody (ours: {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN}
  immutable logs)
- **Prosecution**: Gatwick 2018 perps never caught - no evidence trail

- Parents seeking screen-free outdoor activities
- Sports training market growing at {MARKET.OUTDOOR_TOY_CAGR} CAGR
- Consumer revenue funds enterprise R&D
- D2C channel mature and cost-effective

## Predicted Q&A

:::info Soonami Element: Q&A Preparation Predict questions and how you would
answer them. :::

### "Why now?"

**The short answer:** November 2025 proved the problem is urgent and the market
is ready.

**Detailed response:**

- **Market timing**: 4x increase in European drone incidents YoY. Brussels
  closed twice in one night. This is front-page news.
- **Technology timing**: YOLOv9 + Jetson Orin enables real-time edge AI that
  wasn't possible 2 years ago. Solana's $0.00025/tx makes continuous blockchain
  logging viable.
- **Regulatory timing**: EU and US mandating airport drone defense. Budget being
  allocated.
- **Team timing**: Our combined experience in defense, energy, and real-time
  systems means we're not learning - we're executing.

### "Is your team complete?"

**The short answer:** Core team is complete for seed stage. Hiring plan defined
for Series A.

**Detailed response:**

- **Now (4 co-founders)**: Technical (CTO), Business (CEO), plus 2 additional
  co-founders covering operations and finance
- **Seed hires**: Part-time contractors for specific needs (ML optimization, net
  manufacturing QA)
- **Series A hires**: VP Engineering, VP Sales, ML Engineer, Hardware Engineer
- **Advisory board**: Building with defense/aviation, blockchain, and D2C
  expertise (see [Advisory Playbook](/docs/playbooks/advisory-board-roadmap))

### "What is your specific go-to-market strategy?"

**The short answer:** Consumer first (SkySnare), enterprise second (AeroNet).

**Detailed response:**

1. **Year 1 - Consumer beachhead**:
   - D2C website + Amazon
   - Influencer marketing to active families
   - 5,000 units target
   - Validates tech, generates revenue, funds R&D

2. **Year 2 - Enterprise entry**:
   - Regional airports (not hubs - faster sales cycle)
   - Start with pilots at $50K, convert to $150K+ deals
   - South Africa first (home market), then EU regional
   - 8-10 customers by end of Year 2

### "When can you go live?"

**The short answer:** SkySnare D2C launch Q2 2026. AeroNet pilot Q3 2026.

**Detailed timeline:** | Milestone | Date | Dependencies |
|-----------|------|--------------| | Prototype complete | Feb 2026 | Mechanical
assembly | | CPSC/ASTM certification | Mar 2026 | Testing complete | | D2C
website launch | Apr 2026 | Certification, inventory | | First SkySnare sales |
May 2026 | Marketing ramp | | Enterprise pilot signed | Sep 2026 | Pilot
customer identified | | First AeroNet deployment | Q1 2027 | Pilot success |

**What could accelerate:** Strong pilot customer interest, faster certification.
**What could delay:** Certification issues, supply chain for Jetson Orin.
