## Key Talking Points

### Why Phoenix Rooivalk Wins

1. **Speed is Everything**: In drone defense, milliseconds matter. Our 120-195ms
   response is 10-150x faster than any competitor.

2. **True Autonomy**: We're the only system that operates completely offline. No
   connectivity required, no single point of failure.

3. **Legal Protection**: Blockchain-anchored evidence provides tamper-proof
   audit trails for legal defense and regulatory compliance.

4. **Revenue Today**: x402 protocol is live and generating revenue before
   hardware ships. Most competitors are still in R&D.

5. **Open Architecture**: No vendor lock-in. Customers own their data and can
   customize integrations.
