## Why Now?

### The November 2025 Crisis

| Incident | Impact | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Brussels Airport** | Closed twice Nov 4-5, 2025; 54 flights cancelled | [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/05/latest-drone-sightings-force-flight-cancellations-at-belgiums-main-airport) |
| **Kleine Brogel** | Drones near US nuclear weapons storage | [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drones-europe-nato-airports-russia-hybrid-warfare-belgium-uk-anti-drone-troops/) |
| **UK Response** | RAF anti-drone specialists deployed to Belgium | [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/belgian-airports-disrupted-by-unidentified-drone-flights) |
| **Poland** | 4 airports closed, 23 drones in one day (Sep 2025) | Reuters |
| **Europe-wide** | 4x incident increase YoY | Euronews analysis |

### Why Competitors Can't Solve This

- **Response time**: 5-30 seconds (ours: {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME})
- **Cost**: $1M+ enterprise systems (ours: {AERONET.SETUP_FEE} + {AERONET.MONTHLY_FEE})
- **Evidence**: No blockchain chain-of-custody (ours: {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} immutable logs)
- **Prosecution**: Gatwick 2018 perps never caught - no evidence trail

### Consumer Market Timing

- Parents seeking screen-free outdoor activities
- Sports training market growing at {MARKET.OUTDOOR_TOY_CAGR} CAGR
- Consumer revenue funds enterprise R&D
- D2C channel mature and cost-effective

## Risk Mitigation

| Category | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Compliance** | Certification delays | CPSC/ASTM/EN-71 in progress; FAA SORA alignment |
| **Legal** | Product liability | {CAPITAL.LIABILITY_POLICY} insurance; clear-use labeling |
| **Working Capital** | Cash flow gaps | PO facility ({CAPITAL.PO_FACILITY}), staged production ({CAPITAL.PRODUCTION_RATE}) |
| **Brand** | Confusion risk | Full separation (sites, tone, PR) |
| **Timeline** | Delays | Enterprise deployment Year 2; consumer focus Year 1 |
