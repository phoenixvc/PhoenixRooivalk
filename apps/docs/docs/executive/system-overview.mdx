## Executive Summary

Phoenix Rooivalk is a modular, layered defense system designed to provide
comprehensive protection against low-cost UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) threats.
The system employs a multi-component architecture that cues the most
cost-effective effector first while maintaining command and control (C2)
capabilities in heavy electronic warfare (EW) environments through resilient
free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links.

**Mission**: Provide a modular, layered defense against low-cost UAS threats by
cueing the cheapest effective effector first and maintaining C2 in heavy EW via
resilient FSO and RF links.
