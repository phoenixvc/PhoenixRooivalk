## System Overview

Phoenix Rooivalk is a {PERFORMANCE.AUTONOMY_LEVEL} Autonomous Counter-UAS (Counter-Unmanned
Aerial System) defense platform that represents a revolutionary advancement in
drone defense technology. The system combines cutting-edge artificial
intelligence with military-grade blockchain infrastructure to deliver
unprecedented performance metrics while addressing critical operational
challenges in modern electronic warfare environments.

### Core Value Propositions

#### True Edge Autonomy

Fully offline-capable operations without any network dependency. Phoenix
Rooivalk can detect and neutralize threats autonomously even when disconnected
from command centers or GPS, ensuring continuous protection under infrastructure
outages or jamming attacks.

#### EW Resilience

Designed to continue operation under heavy jamming and GPS denial conditions.
Multi-modal sensors and local consensus algorithms allow the system to function
when traditional communication and navigation aids are compromised.

#### Legal Defensibility

Every engagement decision is logged to an immutable blockchain-based evidence
trail, providing cryptographic proof of actions taken. This auditability
supports Rules of Engagement (ROE) compliance and generates court-admissible
records for post-action review.

#### Flexible Integration

Modular, open architecture supports swapping or upgrading sensors and effectors
from different vendors without core system redesign. The platform's APIs and
microservice design allow easy integration into existing defense ecosystems and
C2 interfaces.

#### Swarm Coordination

Natively supports autonomous swarms of 5-10 drones, allowing coordinated defense
maneuvers. Drones communicate via a resilient mesh network and blockchain
ledger, enabling cooperative tactics like pincer movements and layered area
defense.
