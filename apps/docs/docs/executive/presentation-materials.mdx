### Slide 2: The Challenge

**Modern Drone Threats Are Evolving Faster Than Defenses**

**Current Threats:**

- **Swarm Attacks**: 300% increase in coordinated multi-drone assaults
- **Autonomous Drones**: RF-silent threats bypass {MARKET.FACILITIES_UNPROTECTED} of current systems

- **Malicious Use**: Drug smuggling, surveillance, kinetic attacks

**Current Defense Limitations:**

- **{MARKET.COMPETITOR_RESPONSE_TIME} Response Time**: Too slow for fast-moving threats
- **Cloud Dependency**: Systems fail when communications are jammed
- **No Audit Trail**: Legal defensibility concerns
- **High False Positive Rates**: {MARKET.COMPETITOR_FALSE_POSITIVE} causing operational disruption

**The Result**: Critical infrastructure and military installations remain
vulnerable to evolving drone threats.
