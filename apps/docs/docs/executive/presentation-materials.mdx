## Key Talking Points

### Why Dual-Brand?

1. **Consumer funds R&D**: SkySnare revenue funds AeroNet development
2. **Shared platform**: 60% cost reduction through economies of scale
3. **Separate risk**: Brands are fully separated - different websites, messaging, customers
4. **Market validation**: Consumer success validates tech before enterprise deployment

### Unit Economics

**SkySnare™ Consumer**
- MSRP: {SKYSNARE.MSRP}
- COGS: {SKYSNARE.COGS}
- Contribution Margin: {SKYSNARE.CONTRIBUTION_MARGIN}
- CAC: {SKYSNARE.CAC}
- Return Rate: {SKYSNARE.RETURN_RATE}

**AeroNet™ Enterprise**
- Setup: {AERONET.SETUP_FEE}
- Monthly: {AERONET.MONTHLY_FEE}
- Gross Margin: 44%

### Technology Advantage

| Metric | Phoenix Rooivalk | Competitors |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Response Time | {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME} | 5-30 seconds |
| Detection | {PERFORMANCE.ACCURACY} | 85-95% |
| Offline | Full autonomy | Cloud-dependent |
| Evidence | {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} blockchain | None |

## Use of Funds Detail

| Allocation | % | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|---|--------|---------|
| Product development | {CAPITAL.SEED_PRODUCT_DEV} | $600K | Prototype, testing, certification |
| Inventory | {CAPITAL.SEED_INVENTORY} | $300K | PO facility {CAPITAL.PO_FACILITY} |
| Marketing | {CAPITAL.SEED_MARKETING} | $300K | D2C campaigns, influencers |
| Insurance | {CAPITAL.SEED_INSURANCE} | $150K | {CAPITAL.LIABILITY_POLICY} policy |

## Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Certification delay | CPSC/ASTM in progress; expected Mar 2026 |
| Product liability | {CAPITAL.LIABILITY_POLICY} insurance bound |
| Cash flow | PO facility {CAPITAL.PO_FACILITY}, {CAPITAL.CONVERSION_DAYS} conversion |
| Brand confusion | Full separation (sites, tone, PR) |
| Timeline | Consumer Year 1, Enterprise Year 2 |

## Q&A Preparation

### "Why consumer before enterprise?"

Consumer market is faster to enter:
- Lower regulatory burden (CPSC vs FAA)
- D2C channel mature and cost-effective
- Revenue validates tech before enterprise investment
- Consumer funds enterprise R&D timeline

### "What's the competitive moat?"

1. **Speed**: {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME} vs 5-30s competitors
2. **Cost**: 60% manufacturing advantage (in-house Kevlar)
3. **Evidence**: Only solution with {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} blockchain audit
4. **Dual revenue**: Consumer + Enterprise reduces market risk

### "Why now?"

- Post-pandemic: Parents seeking screen-free activities
- Drone threats: {MARKET.CAGR} CAGR market growth
- Technology: Edge AI and blockchain mature
- Regulatory: Increasing pressure on airports

### "Exit potential?"

| Path | Timeline | Multiple |
|------|----------|----------|
| Series A | 18 months | 3-5x |
| Strategic acquisition | 3-5 years | 10-15x |
| IPO | 5-7 years | 20-30x |
