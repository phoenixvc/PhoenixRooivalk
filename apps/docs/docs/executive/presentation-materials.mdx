## Key Talking Points

### Why Dual-Brand?

1. **Consumer funds R&D**: SkySnare revenue funds AeroNet development
2. **Shared platform**: Economies of scale from shared net launcher technology
3. **Separate risk**: Brands are fully separated - different websites, messaging, customers
4. **Market validation**: Consumer success validates tech before enterprise deployment

### Unit Economics

**SkySnare™ Consumer**
- MSRP: {SKYSNARE.MSRP}
- COGS: {SKYSNARE.COGS}
- Contribution Margin: {SKYSNARE.CONTRIBUTION_MARGIN}
- CAC: {SKYSNARE.CAC}
- Return Rate: {SKYSNARE.RETURN_RATE}

**AeroNet™ Enterprise**
- Setup: {AERONET.SETUP_FEE}
- Monthly: {AERONET.MONTHLY_FEE}
- Gross Margin: 44%

### Technology Advantage (For AI/Blockchain Investors)

| Metric | Phoenix Rooivalk | Competitors |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Response Time** | {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME} | 5-30 seconds |
| **Detection Model** | YOLOv9 (mAP 95.7%) | Legacy CV |
| **Hardware** | {HARDWARE.COMPUTE_PLATFORM} ({HARDWARE.COMPUTE_TOPS}) | Cloud-dependent |
| **Accuracy** | {PERFORMANCE.ACCURACY} | 85-95% |
| **False Positive** | {PERFORMANCE.FALSE_POSITIVE} | 15-25% |
| **Evidence Chain** | {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} @ {BLOCKCHAIN.COST_PER_TX}/tx | None |
| **Finality** | {BLOCKCHAIN.FINALITY} | N/A |

:::info Why This Matters
- **Edge AI**: No cloud latency, works offline, GDPR compliant (data stays local)
- **Blockchain**: Court-admissible evidence, immutable audit trail, cross-border prosecution
- **Gatwick 2018**: £60M cost, 140K passengers, perps never caught - no evidence chain

|------|------------|
| Certification delay | CPSC/ASTM in progress; expected Mar 2026 |
| Product liability | {CAPITAL.LIABILITY_POLICY} insurance bound |
| Cash flow | PO facility {CAPITAL.PO_FACILITY}, {CAPITAL.CONVERSION_DAYS} conversion |
| Brand confusion | Full separation (sites, tone, PR) |
| Timeline | Consumer Year 1, Enterprise Year 2 |

## Q&A Preparation

### "Why consumer before enterprise?"

Consumer market is faster to enter:
- Lower regulatory burden (CPSC vs FAA)
- D2C channel mature and cost-effective
- Revenue validates tech before enterprise investment
- Consumer funds enterprise R&D timeline

### "What's the competitive moat?"

1. **Speed**: {PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME} vs 5-30s competitors
2. **Cost**: In-house net manufacturing from existing Kevlar stock
3. **Evidence**: Only solution with {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} blockchain audit
4. **Dual revenue**: Consumer + Enterprise reduces market risk

### "Why now?"

- **November 2024 crisis**: Brussels 8-day closure, Poland 4 airports, Denmark drone ban
- **4x YoY increase** in European airport drone incidents
- **Edge AI maturity**: YOLOv9 + Jetson Orin enables real-time edge inference
- **Blockchain cost collapse**: {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} at {BLOCKCHAIN.COST_PER_TX}/tx makes continuous logging viable
- **Regulatory pressure**: EU and US mandating airport drone defense

### "Why Solana for blockchain?"

| Consideration | {BLOCKCHAIN.PRIMARY_CHAIN} | Ethereum | Polygon |
|---------------|---------|----------|---------|
| **TPS** | {BLOCKCHAIN.TPS} | ~15 | ~7,000 |
| **Cost/tx** | {BLOCKCHAIN.COST_PER_TX} | $5-50+ | $0.01 |
| **Finality** | {BLOCKCHAIN.FINALITY} | 12-15 min | 2+ min |
| **Annual cost** | ~{BLOCKCHAIN.ANNUAL_COST} | $150K+ | $10K+ |

Solana gives us court-admissible evidence at negligible cost.

### "What's your AI differentiation?"

- **YOLOv9**: Latest YOLO with 95.7% mAP, 4.6% improvement over v8
- **Edge-first**: {HARDWARE.COMPUTE_PLATFORM} with {HARDWARE.COMPUTE_TOPS} - no cloud dependency
- **{PERFORMANCE.RESPONSE_TIME}**: 10-150x faster than cloud-dependent competitors
- **{PERFORMANCE.FALSE_POSITIVE} false positive**: vs 15-25% industry average

### "Exit potential?"

| Path | Timeline | Multiple |
|------|----------|----------|
| Series A | 18 months | 3-5x |
| Strategic acquisition | 3-5 years | 10-15x |
| IPO | 5-7 years | 20-30x |
