## Migration Considerations

### Current State → Target State

| Phase | Timing | Platform | Scope |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | Now | Custom TS | Simple features (competitor, SWOT, recommendations) |
| **Phase 2** | Now | LangChain | Complex features (agents, workflows, memory) |
| **Phase 3** | Future | Cognitive Mesh | Compliance-critical features |

### Migration Triggers for Cognitive Mesh

| Trigger | Description | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Defense contract** | Formal compliance requirements | Begin migration planning |
| **EU AI Act scope** | High-risk AI classification | Evaluate cognitive-mesh readiness |
| **Audit requirement** | Mandatory decision logging | Migrate affected features |
| **Multi-agent scale** | >5 coordinating agents | Evaluate Agency Layer |
| **Ethical concerns** | AI decisions with human impact | Leverage ethical reasoning layer |

### Migration Effort Estimates

| From | To | Effort | Risk |
|------|-----|--------|------|
| Custom TS | LangChain | 1-2 weeks | Low |
| LangChain | Cognitive Mesh | 4-8 weeks | Medium |
| Custom TS | Cognitive Mesh | 6-10 weeks | Medium-High |

---

## Risk Assessment

### Platform Risks

| Risk | Custom | LangChain | Cognitive Mesh |
|------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Technical debt** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Compliance gaps** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Vendor lock-in** | Low | Medium | Low |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Community support** | None | High | None |
| **Development stall** | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Stack mismatch** | Low | Low | High |

### Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cognitive Mesh not ready | Continue with LangChain, monitor development |
| LangChain breaking changes | Pin versions, maintain abstraction layer |
| Compliance audit before CM ready | Document manual compliance processes |
| Stack mismatch | Plan for gradual .NET adoption if needed |

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Now - 6 months)

1. **Continue LangChain** for complex features (ADR-0018 through ADR-0023)
2. **Keep Custom TS** for simple, performance-critical paths
3. **Monitor Cognitive Mesh** development progress
4. **Document compliance** processes manually

### Medium-term (6-18 months)

1. **Evaluate Cognitive Mesh** readiness quarterly
2. **Build abstraction layers** to ease future migration
3. **Track compliance requirements** from contracts
4. **Plan .NET skill development** if CM adoption likely

### Long-term (18+ months)

1. **Migrate to Cognitive Mesh** when:
   - Compliance requirements mandate
   - Platform reaches production readiness
   - Feature parity with LangChain achieved
2. **Maintain hybrid approach** if needed
3. **Contribute to Cognitive Mesh** development

### Key Decision Points

| Decision | Timing | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Adopt Cognitive Mesh pilot | When 1.0 released | Feature parity, stability |
| Full migration planning | When compliance required | Contract mandates |
| Sunset LangChain | When CM mature | All features migrated |

---

## Conclusion

**Current recommendation**: Use LangChain for complex AI features while monitoring Cognitive Mesh development.

**Future pivot point**: When compliance requirements increase (defense contracts, EU AI Act), Cognitive Mesh becomes the preferred platform due to its built-in governance, audit logging, and ethical reasoning capabilities.

The weighted decision matrix shows LangChain currently winning (3.76 vs 3.43), but this will invert when compliance criteria weight increases from 18% to 30%+.
