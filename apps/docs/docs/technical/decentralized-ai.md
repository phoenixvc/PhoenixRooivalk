# Phoenix Rooivalk Decentralized AI Integration

## Morpheus Network Integration Potential

Morpheus represents a novel approach to decentralized AI, launching on Arbitrum
mainnet in November 2024 with over 1 million users and $3B total value staked.
The network enables personal AI "Smart Agents" executing smart contracts through
natural language, built on distributed peer-to-peer inference with prompt and
response privacy.
