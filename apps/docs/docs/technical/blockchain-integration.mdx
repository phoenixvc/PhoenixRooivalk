## Solana for Immutable Evidence Anchoring

Solana provides exceptional capabilities for evidence anchoring in counter-drone
operations with **{BLOCKCHAIN.TPS_REAL_WORLD} real-world TPS**, **{BLOCKCHAIN.FINALITY_SUB} finality**, and
remarkably low costs at **{BLOCKCHAIN.COST_PER_TX} per transaction**. For a high-frequency
logging scenario of one transaction per second continuously, annual costs would
be only {BLOCKCHAIN.ANNUAL_COST} compared to orders of magnitude more on other blockchains.
