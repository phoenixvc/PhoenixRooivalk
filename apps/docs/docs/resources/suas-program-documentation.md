| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Safety Protocols**        | Adapt ADM, PAVE, and IMSAFE checklists for counter-drone operations  |
| **Role Definitions**        | Map RPIC and VO responsibilities to Phoenix Rooivalk operator roles  |
| **Documentation Standards** | Integrate flight log templates with blockchain evidence anchoring    |
| **Training Requirements**   | Align Part 107 certification with Phoenix Rooivalk operator training |
| **Emergency Procedures**    | Extend emergency checklists to include counter-UAS scenarios         |

### Recommended Integration Points

1. **Training Programs**: Incorporate DHS framework into Phoenix Rooivalk
   operator certification requirements
2. **Compliance Framework**: Reference FAA regulations and reporting
   requirements in compliance documentation
