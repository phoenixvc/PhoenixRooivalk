## Executive Summary

Phoenix Rooivalk's manufacturing strategy leverages a dual entity approach:
{TEAM.COMPANY_STRUCTURE} for US/ITAR markets and {TEAM.SECONDARY_ENTITY} for global non-ITAR
markets. The hybrid production model balances in-house manufacturing for IP
protection with strategic sourcing for cost optimization and supply chain
resilience.

## Manufacturing Philosophy

### Hybrid Production Model

**In-House Manufacturing Scope**

- Composite airframes using local carbon fiber
- System integration and final assembly
- Proprietary electronics (sensor fusion boards)
- Software development and AI training

**Strategic Sourcing**

- Motors and ESCs from T-Motor/Hobbywing (proven reliability)
- Sensors from established suppliers (FLIR, Continental)
- Computing from NVIDIA/Qualcomm (avoid custom silicon)
- Battery cells from CATL/BYD (scale economics)

**Rationale**

- IP protection for core technologies
- Cost optimization through strategic sourcing
- Supply chain resilience through dual sourcing
- Quality control through in-house integration
