# Pilot Customer Roadmap

**Goal**: Get 2-3 LOIs (Letters of Intent) or soft commitments in 30 days.

---

## Why LOIs Matter

| What Investors See | What It Signals |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "We're in talks with airports" | Vague, unverifiable |
| "Lanseria Airport signed LOI for $150K pilot" | Market validation, specific demand |
| "3 LOIs totaling $400K Year 1 pipeline" | Revenue visibility, reduced risk |

**LOIs don't guarantee revenue, but they prove:**
1. You can sell
2. Someone will pay
3. The problem is real enough to solve

---

## Week 1: Target List & Outreach (Days 1-7)

### Day 1-2: Build Your Hit List (20 targets)

**Tier 1: Regional Airports (Highest Priority)**

South African airports without major C-UAS:
| Airport | Location | Why Target |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Lanseria International | Johannesburg | 2nd busiest, private ownership |
| Grand Central | Midrand | GA airport, security-conscious |
| Wonderboom | Pretoria | Military adjacent |
| Virginia | Durban | Regional, growing traffic |
| George | Western Cape | Tourist hub |

**How to find the right contact:**
1. LinkedIn: Search "[Airport] Security Manager" or "Operations Director"
2. Call main line: "Who handles airfield security?"
3. Airport Authority websites: Look for tender/procurement contacts

**Tier 2: Event Venues**

| Venue | Location | Why Target |
|-------|----------|------------|
| FNB Stadium | Johannesburg | High-profile events |
| Cape Town Stadium | Cape Town | International events |
| Sun City | Northwest | Resort security |
| Kyalami | Midrand | Motorsport, VIP events |

**Tier 3: Critical Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Examples | Why Target |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Power stations | Eskom facilities | Drone surveillance risk |
| Data centers | Teraco, Africa Data Centres | Security-conscious |
| Ports | Durban, Cape Town | Logistics security |
| Mining | Visible from public roads | Industrial espionage |

### Day 3-4: Craft Your Outreach

**Email Template (Cold Outreach)**

```
Subject: Drone incident response for [Airport Name] - quick question

Hi [Name],

After the Brussels Airport shutdowns last month (twice in one night, 54 flights cancelled), I'm reaching out to regional airport security teams who might be evaluating drone defense options.

We're Phoenix Rooivalk - we build edge AI drone detection with sub-200ms response and net capture systems. Our approach:
- 10-150x faster response than cloud-based competitors
- Blockchain evidence chain (Gatwick perps never caught)
- Regional airport pricing (not $1M+ enterprise systems)

I'm not trying to sell you anything today. I'm trying to understand:
1. Is drone intrusion on your radar as a security concern?
2. What's your current approach (if any)?

Either way, would you have 15 minutes for a call this week?

Regards,
[Your name]
Phoenix Rooivalk
[Phone] | [Email]

P.S. Happy to share our technical brief on the November 2025 European incidents if useful.
```

**LinkedIn Message (Shorter)**

```
Hi [Name], saw your role at [Airport]. After the Brussels shutdowns, wanted to connect with SA airport security professionals. We're building affordable drone detection/capture tech for regional airports. Not selling - genuinely curious about how SA airports are thinking about this threat. Open to a quick call?
```

### Day 5-7: Execute Outreach

**Daily targets:**
- 5 cold emails
- 5 LinkedIn connection requests with message
- 2 phone calls to airport main lines

**Tracking spreadsheet:**

| Company | Contact | Channel | Date Sent | Response | Next Step |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Lanseria | John Smith | Email | Dec 2 | Pending | Follow up Dec 5 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Follow-up cadence:**
- Day 3: If no response, LinkedIn connect
- Day 5: Follow-up email ("Floating this to the top...")
- Day 7: Phone call to main line

---

## Week 2: Conversations & Discovery (Days 8-14)

### Day 8-10: Discovery Calls

**Goal:** Understand their pain, not pitch your product

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Have you had any drone incidents or near-misses?"
2. "What's your current approach to drone detection?"
3. "If you could solve one security challenge this year, what would it be?"
4. "What would a solution need to look like for you to consider it?"
5. "Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"

**Red flags (move on):**
- "We have no budget for new security"
- "Our parent company handles all procurement"
- "This isn't a priority for us"

**Green flags (pursue):**
- "We've been looking at this"
- "Our board has asked about drones"
- "We had an incident last year"
- "What would it cost?"

---

### Day 11-14: Proposal & LOI Request

**When to ask for an LOI:**
- After 1-2 good conversations
- When they express genuine interest
- When they ask about pricing or timeline

**The Ask:**

```
"Based on our conversations, it sounds like [specific pain point] is something you're actively trying to solve.

We're raising our seed round right now, and having a pilot commitment from a respected airport like [name] would be meaningful.

Would you be open to signing a non-binding Letter of Intent for a pilot program? It wouldn't commit you to anything - it just says you're interested in being an early customer if the technology meets your needs.

I can send over a one-page draft today."
```

## Week 3: Follow-Up & Close (Days 15-21)

### Day 15-17: Follow Up on Proposals

**If they're stalling:**

- "What would you need to see to feel comfortable signing?"

**If they need a demo:**
- Share your demo videos (see [Demo Video Roadmap](./demo-video-roadmap))
- Offer a video call walkthrough
- If you have hardware, offer to bring it

**If they want to meet in person:**
- DO IT. In-person closes faster.
- Bring printed leave-behind materials
- Bring any prototype hardware

---

### Day 18-21: Close or Disqualify

**For warm leads:**
1. Send final LOI draft
2. Offer to visit in person to sign
3. Set hard deadline: "We're closing our investor materials by [date]"

**For cold leads:**
- Move to nurture list

**Acceptable alternatives if they won't sign:**
- Email confirming interest: "Yes, we'd be interested in a pilot"
- Meeting notes: Documented interest from security director
- Referral: "Talk to our head of ops, they're very interested"

---

### Day 26-28: Build Pipeline Documentation

Create an investor-ready pipeline table:

| Customer | Sector | Status | Contact | Potential Value |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Lanseria Airport | Regional Airport | **LOI Signed** | John Smith, Security Dir | $150K + $25K/mo |
| Grand Central | GA Airport | Proposal Sent | Mary Jones, Ops Mgr | $80K + $15K/mo |
| FNB Stadium | Event Venue | In Discussion | Security Team | $50K pilot |
| **Total Pipeline** | | | | **$280K+** |

---

### Day 29-30: Prepare Investor Narrative

**For your pitch:**
> "We have 2 signed LOIs totaling $230K in Year 1 potential revenue, with 5 additional prospects in our pipeline. Lanseria Airport, South Africa's second-busiest, has committed to a pilot program pending technology demonstration."

**For Q&A:**
- Be ready to name specific companies
- Know each contact's title and pain point
- Have the LOI PDFs on your laptop to show

---

## Tips for Success

### Do:
- ✅ Follow up relentlessly (most deals die from lack of follow-up)
- ✅ Ask for referrals ("Who else should I talk to?")
- ✅ Make it easy to say yes (draft all documents)
- ✅ Create urgency ("We're closing investor materials by X")

### Don't:
- ❌ Oversell - be honest about your stage
- ❌ Promise timelines you can't keep
- ❌ Discount aggressively (devalues your product)
- ❌ Take "no" personally (it's data, not rejection)

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We don't have budget" | "I understand. Would you be open to a pilot in Q2 2026? We could start planning now." |
| "We need to see it working" | "Absolutely. Would a video demo work, or would you prefer an on-site demonstration?" |
| "This isn't a priority" | "I hear you. Out of curiosity, what would make it a priority? An incident? New regulations?" |
| "We're already talking to [competitor]" | "Great - that shows you're taking this seriously. What are you looking for that they might not provide?" |
| "I need to check with my boss" | "Of course. Would it help if I prepared a one-pager for them? Or should I join that call?" |

---

## Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Outreach sent | 50+ | Numbers game |
| Conversations | 10-15 | From 50 outreach |
| Proposals sent | 5-8 | From 10-15 convos |
| LOIs signed | 2-3 | From 5-8 proposals |
| Pipeline value | $200K+ | Enough to cite in pitch |
