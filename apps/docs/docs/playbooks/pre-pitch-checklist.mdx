## Day Of (2 Hours Before)

### Personal

- [ ] Dress appropriately (smart casual for most VC)
- [ ] Arrive 15 minutes early

### Tech Setup

- [ ] Have demo videos in separate window, ready

- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Smile and relax shoulders

### Opening Ready

---

## During the Pitch

### Delivery Reminders
- [ ] Start with the problem (hook them immediately)
- [ ] Speak slower than you think you need to
- [ ] Pause after key points
- [ ] Watch their body language
- [ ] If they interrupt with a question, answer it (don't defer)

### Time Management
- [ ] 3-min pitch: 5 slides, ~35s each
- [ ] 5-min pitch: 6 slides, ~45s each

### Common Traps
