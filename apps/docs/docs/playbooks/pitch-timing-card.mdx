## Q&A Cheat Sheet

### "Why now?"

> "November 2025 - Brussels closed twice in one night. 4x incident increase YoY.
> Plus YOLOv9 and Jetson Orin now make edge AI viable. Market is ready, tech is
> ready, we're ready."

### "Why you?"

> "50+ years combined experience. We've built safety-critical systems in mining,
> energy, defense. We know hardware, we know blockchain, we're not learning on
> the job."

### "What's your moat?"

> "Four moats: Edge AI architecture, blockchain from day 1, in-house net
> manufacturing, and dual-revenue insulation."

### "When do you go live?"

> "SkySnare D2C: Q2 2026. AeroNet pilot: Q3 2026. First enterprise revenue: Q1
> 2027."

### "Who's your competition?"

> "DroneShield, Dedrone, Fortem. They're slower (5-30s vs our 120ms), more
> expensive ($1M+ vs $150K), and have no evidence chain. Gatwick perps were
> never caught - we solve that."

### "What's the use of funds?"

> "40% product dev, 20% inventory, 20% marketing, 10% insurance, 5% compliance,
> 5% operations."

## Opening Lines

### 3-Minute (Hook Fast)

> "This is happening right now. Last month - November 2025 - Brussels Airport
> shut down twice in one night. 54 flights cancelled. UK sent Royal Air Force
> troops. And still, no affordable solution for regional airports. We're
> building it."

### 5-Minute (More Context)

> "The drone threat is real and accelerating. November 2025 - Brussels Airport
> closed twice in one night, 54 flights cancelled, drones spotted near NATO
> nuclear storage. Incidents are up 4x year-over-year across Europe. The C-UAS
> market is $6.6 billion today, growing to $20 billion by 2030. Current
> solutions cost over a million dollars and take 5-30 seconds to respond. We're
> building something better."

---

## Closing Lines

### The Ask

> "We're raising $1.5 million. Funds go to product development, inventory, and
> marketing. This gives us runway to April 2027 - enough to hit certification,
> ship 5,000 units, and sign our first enterprise pilot. Series A follows with
> proven revenue. Questions?"

### If They're Interested

> "What would be helpful for your process? Happy to share the data room, connect
> you with our technical advisors, or schedule a deeper dive on any area."

### If They're Not Sure

> "I understand you need to discuss internally. What additional information
> would be helpful? And what's the best timeline to follow up?"
