# Advisory Board Roadmap

**Goal**: Recruit 2-3 credible advisors in 3 weeks who add real value and
investor confidence.

## Why Advisors Matter

| Advisor Type         | What Investors See                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Defense/Military** | "They understand the customer and regulatory landscape"       |
| **Aviation/Airport** | "They have industry connections we can leverage"              |
| **Blockchain/Web3**  | "They know how to build token economics and crypto community" |
| **Hardware/D2C**     | "They've scaled consumer products before"                     |

**The formula:**

> 2-3 advisors × relevant experience = reduced execution risk in investor's mind

**Research checklist:**

- [ ] Read their LinkedIn thoroughly

- [ ] Check if they advise other startups
- [ ] Find mutual connections

---

### Day 3-5: Warm Introductions

**Best path:** Mutual connection introduces you

**Email to mutual connection:**

```
Subject: Quick favor - intro to [Advisor Name]?

Hi [Name],

I saw you're connected to [Advisor Name] on LinkedIn. We're building drone capture technology at Phoenix Rooivalk, and their background in [specific thing] is exactly what we need.

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Happy to send you a blurb to forward.

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

**Blurb for them to forward:**

```
"[Name] is building drone detection/capture tech for airports. They're raising a seed round and looking for advisors with [defense/blockchain/hardware] experience. Worth a conversation if you're open to it."
```

---

### Day 5-7: Cold Outreach

**LinkedIn message (if no mutual connection):**

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following your work at [Company/Project] - particularly [specific thing they did].

We're building counter-drone technology at Phoenix Rooivalk (edge AI detection + net capture). We're raising our seed round and looking to build an advisory board.

Given your experience in [specific area], I'd love to get 15 minutes of your perspective. No pitch - genuinely looking for advice on [specific challenge].

Would you be open to a quick call?

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Key principles:**

- Be specific about why THEM
- Lead with asking for advice, not asking to be an advisor
- Mention something specific they've done
- Keep it short

---

## Week 2: Conversations & Value Exchange (Days 8-14)

### Day 8-10: Discovery Calls

**Agenda for first call (30 min):**

1. 5 min: Your background, how you found them
2. 10 min: Ask about their experience, current focus
3. 10 min: Share Phoenix Rooivalk, ask for advice
4. 5 min: "Would you be interested in staying involved?"

**Questions to ask:**

- "What's keeping you busy these days?"
- "What do you wish you'd known when you were at our stage?"
- "Who else should I be talking to?"
- "What would you do differently if you were us?"

**What you're evaluating:**

- Do they actually know the space?
- Are they genuinely interested?
- Do they have relevant connections?
- Will they respond to emails?

---

### Day 11-14: The Soft Ask

**After a good conversation:**

```
"I really appreciate your perspective on [specific thing]. This is exactly the kind of insight we need as we grow.

We're building out an advisory board - nothing too formal, but people we can call on for strategic guidance a few times a year.

Would you be open to being an advisor? I can send over what that would look like."
```

**If they say yes:**

- Send advisor agreement (template below)
- Propose equity/compensation
- Schedule follow-up call

**If they hesitate:**

- "No pressure at all. Would it help if I sent you more info on what we're
  building?"
- "What would you need to see to feel comfortable?"
- Move on if not interested
