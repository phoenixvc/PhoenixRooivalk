# Soonami Pitch Deck Structure Guide

This guide outlines the ideal pitch deck structure recommended by Soonami for
their accelerator programs and investor pitches.

---

## The 9-Slide Framework

### 1. The Problem

**Question to answer:** What problem are you trying to tackle?

**Best practices:**

- Make it relatable and urgent
- Use specific data points and examples
- Show the pain is real and widespread
- Recent events strengthen urgency (e.g., Brussels Nov 2025)

**Common mistakes:**

- Too vague ("drones are a problem")
- No quantification of the pain
- Missing emotional hook

---

### 2. The Solution

**Question to answer:** How are you going to solve the problem?

**Best practices:**

- Clear, concise explanation of your approach
- Show the "aha moment" - why your solution is better
- Demo or visual if possible
- Connect directly to the problem stated

**Common mistakes:**

- Too technical too early
- Features instead of benefits
- Not clearly differentiated

---

### 3. The Market

**Question to answer:** TAM, SAM, SOM - be realistic in your assessment

**Best practices:**

- Bottom-up calculation preferred over top-down
- Show how you calculated each number
- Be conservative - investors will challenge you
- Cite credible sources (MarketsandMarkets, Gartner, etc.)

**Key metrics:** | Metric | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------| | **TAM** | Total Addressable Market -
everyone who could theoretically buy | $6.64B C-UAS market | | **SAM** |
Serviceable Addressable Market - segment you can reach | $1.2B regional airports
| | **SOM** | Serviceable Obtainable Market - realistic year 1-3 capture | $15M
(10-15 customers) |

**Common mistakes:**

- Unrealistic TAM claims ("$100B market!")
- No SAM/SOM breakdown
- Top-down only ("1% of China...")

---

### 4. Traction

**Question to answer:** What kind of traction did you develop and how do you
want to still accelerate?

**Best practices:**

- Show progress, not just plans
- Use metrics appropriate to your stage
- Be honest about what's real vs. planned
- Show trajectory, not just snapshots

**Traction types by stage:** | Stage | Strong Traction | Acceptable |
|-------|-----------------|------------| | **Pre-seed** | Prototype working,
LOIs | Team assembled, design complete | | **Seed** | Paying customers, pilots |
LOIs, significant user testing | | **Series A** | Revenue, growth metrics |
Multiple paying customers |

**Common mistakes:**

- Confusing "interest" with traction
- No timeline or milestones
- Hiding lack of progress

---

### 5. The Story

**Question to answer:** What is your connection? Why did you start this?

**Best practices:**

- Personal connection to the problem
- Founder-market fit narrative
- "Why you, why now" answer built in
- Authentic, not manufactured

**Story elements:**

- Personal experience with the problem
- Unique insight that led to the solution
- Why this team is uniquely positioned
- The moment of clarity / origin story

**Common mistakes:**

- No personal connection
- Generic "saw an opportunity"
- Skipping this slide entirely

---

### 6. Go-to-Market

**Question to answer:** How do you specifically want to enter the market? Where
do you want to focus first?

**Best practices:**

- Be specific about first customers
- Show you understand the sales cycle
- Channel strategy clear (D2C, B2B, partnerships)
- Geography and segment focus defined

**Key questions to answer:**

1. Who is your first customer segment?
2. How will you reach them?
3. What's the sales cycle length?
4. What's your CAC and how will you reduce it?
5. What's your expansion strategy after beachhead?

**Common mistakes:**

- "We'll sell to everyone"
- No channel strategy
- Unrealistic sales cycle assumptions

---

### 7. Financials

**Question to answer:** Give an overview of financials, costs, and revenues for
the first 3–5 years

**Best practices:**

- Show you understand unit economics
- Be realistic about ramp time
- Include key assumptions
- Show path to profitability (or explain why growth > profit)

**Key metrics to include:** | Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------| | **Revenue projection** | Growth trajectory | |
**Gross margin** | Unit economics health | | **Burn rate** | How fast you spend
| | **Runway** | Time until next raise needed | | **Break-even** | When you
become self-sustaining |

**Common mistakes:**

- Hockey stick with no explanation
- Ignoring costs
- Unrealistic growth assumptions
- No sensitivity analysis

---

### 8. The Team

**Question to answer:** Describe your team and their positions and
responsibilities

**Best practices:**

- Highlight relevant experience
- Show complementary skills
- Include advisors if they add credibility
- Be honest about gaps and hiring plans

**What investors look for:**

- Founder-market fit
- Technical capability to build
- Business capability to sell
- Previous startup or relevant industry experience
- Commitment (full-time?)

**Common mistakes:**

- Listing everyone without relevance
- Hiding team gaps
- No clear roles defined

---

### 9. Competitive Analysis

**Question to answer:** Who are your current competitors? List them in a matrix
with important categories and why you are better

**Best practices:**

- Include all relevant competitors (direct and indirect)
- Choose comparison categories honestly
- Show where you win AND where others might win
- Explain your sustainable advantage

**Competition matrix format:** | Feature | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------| | Speed | ✅ Best | ⚠️ Medium |
❌ Slow | | Price | ✅ Affordable | ❌ Expensive | ⚠️ Medium | | Evidence | ✅
Blockchain | ❌ None | ❌ None |

**Common mistakes:**

- "We have no competition" (red flag!)
- Cherry-picking categories you win
- Not knowing competitors deeply
- Ignoring indirect competition

---

## Predicted Q&A (Prepare These)

Soonami specifically recommends preparing answers for:

### "Why now?"

**Framework:**

- Market timing (recent events, regulation changes)
- Technology timing (what's now possible that wasn't before)
- Team timing (why you're ready now)

### "Is your team complete?"

**Framework:**

- Acknowledge gaps honestly
- Show hiring plan with specific roles
- Explain how you'll fill gaps (advisors, contractors, hires)

### "What is the best specific go-to-market strategy?"

**Framework:**

- Beachhead market clearly defined
- First 10 customers identified
- Channel strategy specific
- Timeline realistic

### "When can you go live?"

**Framework:**

- Clear milestones to launch
- Dependencies identified
- Realistic timeline
- What could accelerate or delay

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Soonami evaluates pitches on:

### 1. Clarity of Communication

- Can a non-expert understand your business?
- Is the problem-solution connection clear?
- Are you avoiding jargon?

### 2. Design & Content of Pitch Deck

- Visual consistency and professionalism
- Information hierarchy (most important first)
- Data visualization quality

### 3. Accuracy in Delivery

- Timing (hitting your time limit)
- Language (confident, not overselling)
- Handling Q&A professionally

### 4. Quality of Presentation

- Confidence and presence
- Storytelling flow
- Audience engagement

## Timing Guidelines

| Pitch Length   | Slides       | Per Slide      |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| **3 minutes**  | 5 slides     | ~35 seconds    |
| **5 minutes**  | 7-9 slides   | ~35-45 seconds |
| **10 minutes** | 10-12 slides | ~50-60 seconds |
| **15 minutes** | 12-15 slides | ~60 seconds    |

**Golden rule:** Practice until you can deliver in 80% of allotted time. Q&A
will happen.

---

## Slide Order Flexibility

While the 9-slide framework is the baseline, order can vary:

**Hook-first order** (for competitions):

1. Problem (with recent event hook)
2. Solution
3. Traction (prove it works)
4. Market
5. Team
6. Go-to-Market
7. Financials
8. Competition
9. Ask

**Story-first order** (for relationship investors):

1. Story (personal connection)
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Market
5. Traction
6. Team
7. Go-to-Market
8. Competition
9. Financials + Ask
