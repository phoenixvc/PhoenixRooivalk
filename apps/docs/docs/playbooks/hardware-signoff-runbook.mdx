# Hardware Signoff Runbook

**Standard workflow for hardware/software signoff between Pieter (Hardware) and
Jurie (Software).**

> **Note:** Pieter is in Cape Town, Jurie is in Bela Bela - all collaboration is
> remote via WhatsApp, video calls, and cloud storage.

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role              | Person           | Location   | Focus Areas                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Lead** | Pieter La Grange | Cape Town  | Mechanical assembly, electronics, testing, drone operations |
| **Software Lead** | Jurie Smit       | Bela Bela  | Edge AI, training pipeline, documentation, integration      |

---

## Signoff Workflow

### 1. Hardware Milestone Completion

When Pieter completes a hardware milestone:

- [ ] Take photos of completed work (multiple angles)
- [ ] Document any deviations from spec
- [ ] Note any issues discovered during assembly/testing
- [ ] Send via WhatsApp with brief description

### 2. Software Integration Check

When Jurie receives hardware update:

- [ ] Review photos and notes
- [ ] Update documentation (week report, specs)
- [ ] Flag any software integration concerns
- [ ] Confirm milestone in weekly report

### 3. Joint Signoff Required

For major milestones, both must approve:

- [ ] Prototype assembly milestones (40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)
- [ ] Test flight results
- [ ] Production readiness decisions
- [ ] BOM changes over 10%

## Hardware Status Tracking

### Current Hardware Inventory

| Item                   | Status           | Location | Owner  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Pi 4 (2GB)             | Active demo      | Pieter   | Pieter |
| Small quads (2x)       | Training targets | Pieter   | Pieter |
| Hexacopter             | In development   | Workshop | Pieter |
| PVC launcher prototype | Testing          | Pieter   | Pieter |

### Drone Fleet for Training Data

| Drone              | Type             | Size Class     | Status      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Black carbon quad  | Racing/freestyle | Small (~250mm) | Available   |
| Orange/yellow quad | Micro            | Tiny (~100mm)  | Available   |
| Hexacopter         | Professional     | Large (~600mm) | In progress |

## Photo Documentation Standards

### Required Shots

For each hardware milestone:

1. **Overview shot** - Full assembly from 1-2m distance
2. **Detail shots** - Key components, connections, modifications
3. **Scale reference** - Include ruler/known object for size
4. **Issue documentation** - Photo any problems found

### File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_component_description.jpg
```

Example: `2026-01-08_hexacopter_wiring.jpg`

### Storage & Sharing

1. **WhatsApp**: Quick photo shares for review
2. **Google Drive / OneDrive**: High-res photos for documentation
3. **Repo**: Final approved photos go to `/apps/docs/static/img/hardware/`

Pieter sends photos via WhatsApp → Jurie downloads and adds to repo.

## Communication Protocol (Remote)

### Daily (as needed)

| Method         | Use Case                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| WhatsApp text  | Quick updates, questions          |
| WhatsApp photo | Hardware progress, issue photos   |
| Voice notes    | Complex explanations              |

### Weekly

- Video call if needed (Google Meet / WhatsApp)
- Summary of hardware progress for weekly report
- List of blockers or parts needed
- Updated timeline if changed

### For Complex Issues

1. WhatsApp call for quick discussion
2. Video call with screen share if showing software
3. Pieter can share phone camera for live hardware view

### Escalation

If blocked >24 hours:

1. WhatsApp message with details
2. If no response in 4 hours, call
3. Document blocker in weekly report
