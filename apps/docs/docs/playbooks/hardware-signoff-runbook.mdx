# Hardware Signoff Runbook

**Standard workflow for hardware/software signoff between Pieter (Hardware) and
Jurie (Software).**

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Person | Focus Areas |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Hardware Lead** | Pieter La Grange | Mechanical assembly, electronics, testing, drone operations |
| **Software Lead** | Jurie Smit | Edge AI, training pipeline, documentation, integration |

---

## Signoff Workflow

### 1. Hardware Milestone Completion

When Pieter completes a hardware milestone:

- [ ] Take photos of completed work (multiple angles)
- [ ] Document any deviations from spec
- [ ] Note any issues discovered during assembly/testing
- [ ] Send via WhatsApp with brief description

### 2. Software Integration Check

When Jurie receives hardware update:

- [ ] Review photos and notes
- [ ] Update documentation (week report, specs)
- [ ] Flag any software integration concerns
- [ ] Confirm milestone in weekly report

### 3. Joint Signoff Required

For major milestones, both must approve:

- [ ] Prototype assembly milestones (40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)
- [ ] Test flight results
- [ ] Production readiness decisions
- [ ] BOM changes over 10%

## Hardware Status Tracking

### Current Hardware Inventory

| Item | Status | Location | Owner |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Pi 4 (2GB) | Active demo | Pieter | Pieter |
| Small quads (2x) | Training targets | Pieter | Pieter |
| Hexacopter | In development | Workshop | Pieter |
| PVC launcher prototype | Testing | Pieter | Pieter |

### Drone Fleet for Training Data

| Drone | Type | Size Class | Status |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| Black carbon quad | Racing/freestyle | Small (~250mm) | Available |
| Orange/yellow quad | Micro | Tiny (~100mm) | Available |
| Hexacopter | Professional | Large (~600mm) | In progress |

---

## Photo Documentation Standards

### Required Shots

For each hardware milestone:

1. **Overview shot** - Full assembly from 1-2m distance
2. **Detail shots** - Key components, connections, modifications
3. **Scale reference** - Include ruler/known object for size
4. **Issue documentation** - Photo any problems found

### File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_component_description.jpg
```

Example: `2026-01-08_hexacopter_wiring.jpg`

### Storage Location

Upload to: `/apps/docs/static/img/hardware/`

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily (as needed)

- WhatsApp for quick updates and photos
- Voice notes for complex explanations

### Weekly

- Summary of hardware progress for weekly report
- List of blockers or parts needed
- Updated timeline if changed

### Escalation

If blocked >24 hours:

1. WhatsApp message with details
2. If no response in 4 hours, call
3. Document blocker in weekly report
