# Tokenomics Roadmap

**Goal**: Design a credible token utility model for blockchain investors without derailing your equity seed round.

---

## The Seed Stage Reality

| What Investors Want to Hear | What to Avoid |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| "We're designing token utility for future rounds" | "We're launching a token next month" |
| "Equity-first, token later when we have network effects" | "We'll do an ICO instead of VC" |
| "Here's our token utility thesis" | "We haven't thought about it" |
| "Regulatory clarity before token launch" | "We'll figure out compliance later" |

**Key message:**
> "We're raising equity for seed. We're designing token utility for when we have real network effects to tokenize. Here's our thesis."

---

## Week 1: Token Utility Design (Days 1-7)

### Day 1-2: Understand Your Network Effects

**What creates value in Phoenix Rooivalk that could be tokenized?**

```
Detection Network Value
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
More devices deployed
        ↓
More detection events logged
        ↓
Larger threat intelligence dataset
        ↓
Better AI model accuracy
        ↓
More valuable to each user
        ↓
More devices deployed... (flywheel)
```

**Tokenizable value:**
1. **Detection data** - Each event has value for threat intelligence
2. **Evidence access** - Legal teams, insurers pay for verified data
3. **Model improvements** - Data contributors improve shared model
4. **Network participation** - Incentivize node operators

---

### Day 3-4: Define Token Utility

**The $PHOENIX Token (Working Name)**

| Utility | Description | When It Matters |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Evidence Access** | Pay to access blockchain evidence logs | Series B |
| **Detection Bounty** | Earn tokens for verified threat detections | Series C |
| **Stake for Priority** | Stake tokens for priority response | Scale |
| **Governance** | Vote on network parameters | Scale |

#### Utility 1: Evidence Access Token

**Who pays:**
- Insurance companies (claims verification)
- Legal teams (prosecution evidence)
- Airports (incident reports)
- Researchers (threat intelligence)

**How it works:**
```
Evidence Request
        ↓
Burn $PHOENIX tokens (or pay in $PHOENIX)
        ↓
Access granted to verified blockchain logs
        ↓
Revenue to token treasury / stakers
```

**Pricing model:**
- Per-event access: 10 $PHOENIX
- Monthly subscription: 1,000 $PHOENIX
- Enterprise unlimited: 10,000 $PHOENIX/year

---

#### Utility 2: Detection Bounty

**Who earns:**
- Device operators who detect threats
- Community validators who verify detections
- Data annotators who improve models

**How it works:**
```
Device detects drone
        ↓
Detection logged to Solana
        ↓
Validator network confirms (3 of 5 validators)
        ↓
Bounty paid: 1 $PHOENIX per verified detection
```

**Anti-gaming:**
- Stake required to be validator
- Slashing for false confirmations
- Geographic diversity requirements
- Rate limiting per device

---

#### Utility 3: Stake for Priority

**Who stakes:**
- Critical infrastructure (airports, data centers)
- High-value venues (stadiums, events)
- Premium enterprise customers

**How it works:**
```
Stake 10,000+ $PHOENIX
        ↓
Priority response queue
        ↓
Guaranteed <100ms response time
        ↓
Priority support and updates
```

---

#### Utility 4: Governance

**What's governed:**
- Detection reward rates
- Evidence access pricing
- Model update approvals
- Network upgrade decisions

**How it works:**
- 1 $PHOENIX = 1 vote
- Proposals require 100 $PHOENIX to submit
- 7-day voting period
- 10% quorum for decisions

---

### Day 5-7: Token Distribution Model

**Standard distribution (for reference):**

| Allocation | Percentage | Vesting |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Team & Founders** | 15-20% | 4 years, 1-year cliff |
| **Investors** | 15-25% | 2 years, 6-month cliff |
| **Ecosystem/Community** | 30-40% | Released via bounties, rewards |
| **Treasury** | 15-20% | DAO-governed |
| **Advisors** | 3-5% | 2 years, 6-month cliff |

**Phoenix Rooivalk proposed allocation:**

| Allocation | % | Tokens | Notes |
|------------|---|--------|-------|
| **Ecosystem Rewards** | 40% | 400M | Detection bounties, evidence sharing |
| **Team** | 18% | 180M | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| **Treasury** | 17% | 170M | DAO-controlled post-decentralization |
| **Investors** | 15% | 150M | Future token rounds |
| **Advisors** | 5% | 50M | 2-year vest |
| **Liquidity** | 5% | 50M | DEX liquidity provision |
| **Total** | 100% | 1B | Fixed supply |

---

## Week 2: Documentation & Messaging (Days 8-14)

### Day 8-10: Create Token Thesis Document

**For internal use and sophisticated investors:**

```markdown
# $PHOENIX Token Utility Thesis

## Executive Summary
$PHOENIX is a utility token for the Phoenix Rooivalk detection network,
enabling evidence access, detection rewards, and network governance.
Token launch is planned for Series B/C when sufficient network effects exist.

## Current Position
- Seed round: Equity only (SAFE or preferred)
- No token sale planned for 18+ months
- Regulatory clarity required before any token event

## Utility Design

### Primary Utility: Evidence Access
- Access to immutable blockchain evidence logs
- Pay-per-event or subscription model
- Pricing in $PHOENIX tokens

### Secondary Utility: Detection Bounties
- Rewards for verified threat detections
- Validator network for confirmation
- Anti-gaming mechanisms

### Future Utilities: Stake & Govern
- Priority response for stakers
- DAO governance post-decentralization

## Token Economics
- Fixed supply: 1 billion $PHOENIX
- No inflation, deflationary from evidence burns
- 40% to ecosystem rewards (earned, not sold)

## Regulatory Approach
- US: No public sale, airdrop to users
- International: Jurisdiction-specific compliance
- Working with [future: legal firm] on framework

## Timeline
- Seed (now): Equity only, token design
- Series A: Finalize token model, legal prep
- Series B: Token launch (if regulatory clear)
- Scale: Full decentralization

## Why Not Token Now?
1. No network effects yet to tokenize
2. Regulatory uncertainty in SA and US
3. Equity investors want clear cap table
4. Token speculation distracts from product
```

### Day 11-12: Prepare Q&A Responses

**For pitch deck Q&A:**

#### "Are you doing a token?"

> "Not for seed - we're raising equity. But we've designed token utility for future rounds. Our thesis is around evidence access and detection bounties. We won't launch a token until we have real network effects and regulatory clarity."

#### "Why not do a token sale now?"

> "Three reasons:
> 1. We don't have network effects yet - nothing to tokenize
> 2. Regulatory landscape is unclear, especially in SA and US
> 3. Token sales create speculators, we want aligned investors
>
> We'll revisit for Series B when we have deployed devices generating real data."

#### "How does blockchain add value?"

> "Right now, it's our evidence chain - every detection logged to Solana, immutable and court-admissible. That's live today.
>
> Future: when we have hundreds of devices, the detection network becomes valuable. Token utility unlocks evidence access for insurers, bounties for operators, and governance for the community."

#### "What chain and why?"

> "Solana. 1K–10K TPS sustained (peak stress-tests higher), 100–150ms finality (Alpenglow upgrade), $0.00006–$0.00009 SOL per transaction (~$0.001–$0.02 USD depending on SOL price). We need high throughput for real-time logging. Ethereum is too expensive, L2s add complexity. Solana gives us what we need at negligible cost."
>
> _Note: Original theoretical peak values (65K TPS, 400ms finality, $0.00025/tx) are not representative of sustained, real-world throughput and cost. The figures above reflect 2025 observed performance._

#### "What about token price speculation?"

> "We've designed utility-first tokenomics. 40% of supply goes to ecosystem rewards - earned by operators, not speculators. Fixed supply with burn mechanics creates natural scarcity, but utility drives value, not speculation."

## Tokenomics Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad |
|--------------|--------------|
| "We'll launch a token in 3 months" | No regulatory prep, no network effects |
| "Token replaces equity round" | Scares institutional investors |
| "70% to team" | Looks like a cash grab |
| "Unlimited supply with inflation" | Dilutes early supporters |
| "Utility TBD" | Shows you haven't thought it through |
| "We'll figure out regulations later" | Red flag for serious investors |

---

## Regulatory Considerations

### South Africa

| Consideration | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| FSCA classification | Unclear for utility tokens |
| Exchange requirements | Crypto asset service provider license |
| Tax treatment | SARS treats as property |

**Recommendation:** Consult SA crypto lawyer before any token event.

### United States

| Consideration | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| SEC Howey Test | Must avoid being a "security" |
| Utility vs. Security | Strong utility = safer |
| Token sale to US persons | Very restricted |

**Safer approaches:**
- Airdrop to users (no sale)
- Non-US token sale
- Wait for clearer regulations

### General Principles

1. **Never sell tokens pre-product** - that's a security
2. **Utility must be real** - not just "governance"
3. **Document everything** - legal memos, board approvals
4. **Work with crypto-native lawyers** - not traditional corp lawyers

## What to Tell Investors

**Seed deck slide (if included):**

```
FUTURE TOKEN UTILITY

Seed round: Equity only
Token launch: Series B+ (18+ months)

Designed utility:
• Evidence Access - Pay to query blockchain logs
• Detection Bounty - Earn for verified threats
• Network Governance - DAO-controlled parameters

Fixed supply: 1B $PHOENIX
40% to ecosystem (earned, not sold)

"We tokenize when we have network effects worth tokenizing."
```

**Verbal pitch:**
> "We've designed token utility, but we're not launching for seed. We need real network effects first - hundreds of devices logging thousands of detections. Then evidence access and bounties make sense. For now, this is an equity round with a blockchain product."

---

_2 weeks. Token thesis documented. Q&A ready. Blockchain investors satisfied without derailing equity round._
