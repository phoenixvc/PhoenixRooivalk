# Patent & IP Roadmap

**Goal**: File provisional patents, register trademarks, and document trade secrets in 30 days.

---

## Why IP Matters for Exit

| IP Status | Acquisition Multiple Impact |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| No IP protection | 3-5x revenue |
| Trade secrets only | 4-6x revenue |
| Provisional patents filed | 5-8x revenue |
| Granted patents | 8-15x revenue |

**Investors ask about IP because:**
1. Defensibility against competitors
2. Exit value for acquirers
3. Licensing potential
4. Shows you're thinking long-term

---

## Your IP Portfolio Strategy

### What to Protect

| IP Type | What | Method | Priority |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| **Net deployment mechanism** | Mechanical launcher design | Provisional Patent | High |
| **Edge AI pipeline** | Detection + response system | Provisional Patent | High |
| **Net manufacturing** | Weaving specs, materials | Trade Secret | Medium |
| **AI training data** | Drone detection dataset | Trade Secret | Medium |
| **SkySnare™** | Consumer brand | Trademark | High |
| **AeroNet™** | Enterprise brand | Trademark | High |
| **Phoenix Rooivalk** | Company brand | Trademark | Medium |

---

## Week 1: Provisional Patent Prep (Days 1-7)

### What is a Provisional Patent?

| Feature | Provisional | Non-Provisional (Utility) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Cost** | $320 (ZA) / $320 (US small entity) | $3,000-15,000+ |
| **Protection** | 12 months priority date | 20 years |
| **Examination** | Not examined | Fully examined |
| **Timeline** | File in days | 2-4 years to grant |
| **Requirement** | Description of invention | Full claims, drawings, etc. |

**Why file provisional first:**
- Establishes priority date (first to file wins)
- Buys 12 months to raise money and file full patent
- Cheap insurance against competitors
- Can say "Patent Pending" to investors

---

### Day 1-2: Invention Disclosure

```

---

### Day 3-5: Prior Art Search

**Do this yourself first (save money):**

1. **Google Patents**: [patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com)
   - Search: "drone capture net"
   - Search: "UAV interception system"
   - Search: "net deployment mechanism"

2. **USPTO**: [patft.uspto.gov](https://patft.uspto.gov)
   - Search patent database
   - Check patent applications too

3. **WIPO (International)**: [patentscope.wipo.int](https://patentscope.wipo.int)
   - Search PCT applications
   - Check international filings

4. **Academic Papers**: Google Scholar
   - Search: "counter-drone net"
   - Search: "net gun drone"

**Document what you find:**

| Patent/Paper | Relevant Claims | How We Differ |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| US10,xxx,xxx | Net deployment for crowd control | Not for aerial targets |
| CN108xxx | Drone capture with tethered net | Our net is untethered |
| Paper: "Net Launch Device Design" | Research prototype | Commercial implementation differs |

---

### Day 6-7: Draft Provisional Applications

**You can write provisionals yourself** (get attorney review if budget allows):

**Structure:**

```markdown
PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

Title: [Descriptive title]

Cross-Reference: [None for first filing]

Field of the Invention:
This invention relates to systems and methods for [general field].

Background:
[Describe the problem, existing solutions, their limitations]

Summary of the Invention:
[Brief overview of your solution]

Detailed Description:
[Thorough description of the invention - be DETAILED]
- How it works
- All components
- All variations you've considered
- All use cases

Drawings:
[Include CAD renderings, schematics, flowcharts]
- Figure 1: Overall system view
- Figure 2: Deployment mechanism detail
- Figure 3: Block diagram of software pipeline

Claims: (Optional for provisional, but helpful)
1. A system for capturing unmanned aerial vehicles comprising:
   a) [first element]
   b) [second element]
   c) [third element]

Abstract:
[One paragraph summary, <150 words]
```

**Critical: Include as much detail as possible.** Provisionals are cheap to file, expensive to have too little detail.

**Prepare for investor questions:**
- "What patents do you have?" → Provisionals filed, PCT planned
- "How defensible is this?" → Core mechanism protected, trade secrets documented
- "What's your freedom to operate?" → Prior art search done, no blocking patents found

## Budget Summary

| Item | DIY Cost | With Attorney |
|------|----------|---------------|
| SA Provisional (x2) | R1,180 (~$65) | R15,000+ (~$800+) |
| US Provisional (x2) | $160-640 | $2,000-5,000 |
| SA Trademarks (x2) | R1,180 (~$65) | R5,000+ (~$275+) |
| Prior art search | Free (your time) | $1,000-3,000 |
| **Total DIY** | **~$300-800** | **~$5,000-15,000** |

**Recommendation:** File provisionals DIY, use attorney for PCT and full patents (Series A budget).

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Public disclosure before filing | May lose patent rights |
| Incomplete provisional | Weak priority date |
| Not documenting trade secrets | Hard to prove in court |
| Forgetting to file PCT by 12 months | Lose international rights |
| Using ™ for unregistered marks | Fine, but weaker than ® |
