# Demo Day Runbook

**Step-by-step guide for Pieter to run the Pi Drone Detector demo.**

> **Remote Support:** Jurie on standby via WhatsApp during demo.

## Quick Reference Card

Print this section and keep it next to the Pi.

| Action              | Command / Step                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Start detection     | `python3 ~/detector/detect.py`            |
| Stop detection      | `Ctrl+C`                                  |
| Check FPS           | Look for `FPS: XX` in terminal            |
| Expected FPS        | 12-18 FPS                                 |
| False positive test | Loop Coke can - should NOT detect         |
| Restart Pi          | `sudo reboot`                             |
| Check camera        | `libcamera-hello --list-cameras`          |
| Call Jurie          | WhatsApp if issues                        |

## T-30 Minutes: Pre-Demo Setup

### Hardware Check

- [ ] Pi 4 powered on (solid green LED)
- [ ] Camera ribbon cable secure (check both ends)
- [ ] microSD card seated properly
- [ ] Power supply connected (5V 3A USB-C)
- [ ] Pi positioned with camera facing demo area

### Network Check (if needed)

- [ ] WiFi connected OR ethernet plugged in
- [ ] Can reach Jurie on WhatsApp

### Software Check

Open terminal on Pi (SSH or direct):

```bash
# Check camera is detected
libcamera-hello --list-cameras
# Should show: Available cameras: 1

# Check model file exists
ls -la ~/models/yolov8n_drone.onnx
# Should show file size ~12MB

# Check detector script exists
ls -la ~/detector/detect.py
# Should show the script
```

### Quick Test Run

```bash
cd ~/detector
python3 detect.py
```

**Look for:**

```
[INFO] Loading model: yolov8n_drone.onnx
[INFO] Camera initialized: 640x480 @ 30fps
[INFO] Starting detection loop...
[INFO] FPS: 15.2 | Detections: 0
```

**Test with Coke can:** Loop a Coke can in front of camera at arm's length.
The model should **NOT** detect it as a drone - this proves the model can
distinguish drones from random objects (low false positive rate).

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

- [ ] Test run successful
- [ ] FPS shows 12-18
- [ ] Coke can NOT detected as drone (proves accuracy)

---

## T-10 Minutes: Final Prep

### Message Jurie

Send WhatsApp: "Starting demo in 10 min, all systems go" (or report any issues)

### Prepare Demo Area

- [ ] Camera has clear view of sky/demo area
- [ ] No obstructions in camera field of view
- [ ] Training drones charged and ready
- [ ] Launcher prototype visible (if showing)

### Start Detection Script

```bash
cd ~/detector
python3 detect.py
```

Leave terminal visible - this is what you'll show during demo.

---

## Demo Script (5-10 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)

**Say:** "This is our Pi Drone Detector running on a $50 Raspberry Pi 4. It's
using a YOLOv8 nano model to detect drones in real-time."

**Show:** Point to the Pi and camera setup.

### False Positive Test - Coke Can Demo (1-2 minutes)

> **Key demo:** Show the model correctly rejects non-drone objects.

**Say:** "Watch the terminal - it's processing video at 12-18 frames per second.
Let me show you how accurate this is."

**Action:** Loop a Coke can slowly in front of the camera at arm's length.

**Say:** "See? The system sees the object but correctly identifies it's NOT a
drone. Zero false positives. This is critical - you don't want security alerts
every time a bird flies by or someone waves their coffee cup."

**Show:** Point to terminal still showing:

```
[INFO] FPS: 15.1 | Detections: 0
```

**Say:** "The model is trained to distinguish drones from everyday objects,
birds, and aircraft. It only alerts on actual drone signatures."

### Live Detection - With Drone (if available)

**Action:** Have someone fly a training drone into camera view.

**Say:** "Now watch what happens with an actual drone..."

**Say:** "There - drone detected instantly. You can see the confidence score -
that's how certain the AI is. The same model that ignored the Coke can
immediately recognizes the drone."

**Show:** Point to terminal showing:

```
[INFO] FPS: 14.8 | Detections: 1 (drone: 0.87)
```

### Multi-Target (if available) (1-2 minutes)

**Action:** Fly second drone into view.

**Say:** "The system can track multiple targets simultaneously. Each gets its
own bounding box and confidence score."

### Edge AI Explanation (1 minute)

**Say:** "This runs entirely on-device - no cloud, no internet required. In
production, we use NVIDIA Jetson for even faster response times under 200
milliseconds. The Pi demo proves our approach works on constrained hardware."

### Closing (30 seconds)

**Say:** "That's real-time drone detection running on edge hardware. The next
step is integrating this with our net launcher for autonomous interception."

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Camera not found"

```bash
# Check connection
libcamera-hello --list-cameras

# If no cameras shown:
# 1. Power off Pi
# 2. Reseat ribbon cable at both ends
# 3. Power on and retry
```

**Time to fix:** 2 minutes

### Low FPS (below 10)

```bash
# Restart with lower resolution
python3 detect.py --resolution 480x360
```

**Time to fix:** 30 seconds

### "Model not found" error

```bash
# Check model location
ls ~/models/

# If missing, re-download from shared link
# Or call Jurie for new link
```

**Time to fix:** 2-5 minutes (need download)

### Script crashes / Python error

```bash
# Restart script
python3 detect.py

# If still crashes, reboot Pi
sudo reboot
# Wait 60 seconds, SSH back in, restart script
```

**Time to fix:** 1-2 minutes

### No detections (drone in view but not detected)

```bash
# Lower confidence threshold
python3 detect.py --conf 0.3
```

**Say to audience:** "Adjusting sensitivity for current lighting conditions."

**Time to fix:** 30 seconds

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Minor Issue (< 2 min fix)

1. Stay calm, explain: "Just adjusting a setting"
2. Apply quick fix from above
3. Continue demo

### Major Issue (can't fix quickly)

1. Say: "Let me show you the recorded demo while we sort this out"
2. Play backup video from phone/laptop
3. WhatsApp Jurie: "Demo issue - [describe problem]"
4. If Jurie can help via SSH, let them fix it
5. Return to live demo if fixed

### Complete Failure

1. Switch to recorded demo video
2. Explain: "This is recorded footage of the same system working"
3. Focus on explaining the technology
4. Offer to schedule follow-up live demo

---

## Post-Demo

### Save Logs (if recording)

```bash
# If you started with --save-log
# Logs are in ~/logs/

# Copy today's log
cp ~/logs/latest.log ~/logs/demo_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

### Shutdown Properly

```bash
# Stop detection script
Ctrl+C

# Shutdown Pi safely
sudo shutdown -h now
```

Wait for green LED to stop blinking before unplugging power.

### Report to Jurie

WhatsApp after demo:

- Did detection work? Y/N
- How many drones detected?
- Any issues?
- Audience reaction?
- Photos/video of demo?

---

## Demo Configurations

### Standard Demo (Recommended)

```bash
python3 detect.py
```

- Resolution: 640x480
- Confidence: 0.5
- Shows terminal output

### With Video Recording

```bash
python3 detect.py --save-video ~/logs/demo.mp4
```

- Records output with bounding boxes
- Use for sharing after demo

### With Preview Window (if monitor connected)

```bash
python3 detect.py --preview
```

- Shows live video with bounding boxes
- Better for audience viewing

### Low-Light / Difficult Conditions

```bash
python3 detect.py --conf 0.3
```

- More sensitive detection
- May have more false positives
